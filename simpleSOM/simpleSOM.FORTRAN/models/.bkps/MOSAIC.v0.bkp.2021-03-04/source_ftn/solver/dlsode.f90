!
! *Arguments:
!     F     :EXT    Name of subroutine for right-hand-side vector f.
!                   This name must be declared EXTERNAL in calling
!                   program.  The form of F must be:
!
!                   SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!                   INTEGER  NEQ
!                   DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!
!                   The inputs are NEQ, T, Y.  F is to set
!
!                   YDOT(i) = f(i,T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQ)),
!                                                     i = 1, ..., NEQ .
!
!     NEQ   :IN     Number of first-order ODE's.
!
!     Y     :INOUT  Array of values of the y(t) vector, of length NEQ.
!                   Input:  For the first call, Y should contain the
!                           values of y(t) at t = T. (Y is an input
!                           variable only if ISTATE = 1.)
!                   Output: On return, Y will contain the values at the
!                           new t-value.
!
!     T     :INOUT  Value of the independent variable.  On return it
!                   will be the current value of t (normally TOUT).
!
!     TOUT  :IN     Next point where output is desired (.NE. T).
!
!     ITOL  :IN     1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or
!                   an array.
!
!     RTOL  :IN     Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
!
!     ATOL  :IN     Absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!                   If ITOL = 1, ATOL need not be dimensioned.
!                   If ITOL = 2, ATOL must be dimensioned at least NEQ.
!
!                   The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled
!                   so as to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!
!                   EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!                   EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!
!                   Thus the local error test passes if, in each
!                   component, either the absolute error is less than
!                   ATOL (or ATOL(i)), or the relative error is less
!                   than RTOL.
!
!                   Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!                   use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative
!                   error control.  Caution:  Actual (global) errors may
!                   exceed these local tolerances, so choose them
!                   conservatively.
!
!     ITASK :IN     Flag indicating the task DLSODE is to perform.
!                   Use ITASK = 1 for normal computation of output
!                   values of y at t = TOUT.
!
!     ISTATE:INOUT  Index used for input and output to specify the state
!                   of the calculation.
!                   Input:
!                    1   This is the first call for a problem.
!                    2   This is a subsequent call.
!                   Output:
!                    1   Nothing was done, because TOUT was equal to T.
!                    2   DLSODE was successful (otherwise, negative).
!                        Note that ISTATE need not be modified after a
!                        successful return.
!                   -1   Excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong
!                        MF).
!                   -2   Excess accuracy requested (tolerances too
!                        small).
!                   -3   Illegal input detected (see printed message).
!                   -4   Repeated error test failures (check all
!                        inputs).
!                   -5   Repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad
!                        Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or
!                        tolerances).
!                   -6   Error weight became zero during problem
!                        (solution component i vanished, and ATOL or
!                        ATOL(i) = 0.).
!
!     IOPT  :IN     Flag indicating whether optional inputs are used:
!                   0   No.
!                   1   Yes.  (See "Optional inputs" under "Long
!                       Description," Part 1.)

!
! *Description:
!     DLSODE solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
!     systems of first-order ODE's,
!
!        dy/dt = f(t,y) ,
!
!     or, in component form,
!
!        dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ))
!                                                  (i = 1, ..., NEQ) .
!
!     DLSODE is a package based on the GEAR and GEARB packages, and on
!     the October 23, 1978, version of the tentative ODEPACK user
!     interface standard, with minor modifications.
!
!     The steps in solving such a problem are as follows.
!
!     a. First write a subroutine of the form
!
!           SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!           INTEGER  NEQ
!           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!
!        which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with
!        f(i).
!
!     b. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
!        Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an
!        eigenvalue whose real part is negative and large in magnitude
!        compared to the reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the
!        problem is nonstiff, use method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff,
!        there are four standard choices for MF, and DLSODE requires the
!        Jacobian matrix in some form.  This matrix is regarded either
!        as full (MF = 21 or 22), or banded (MF = 24 or 25).  In the
!        banded case, DLSODE requires two half-bandwidth parameters ML
!        and MU. These are, respectively, the widths of the lower and
!        upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.  Thus the
!        band consists of the locations (i,j) with
!
!           i - ML <= j <= i + MU ,
!
!        and the full bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
!
!     c. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the
!        Jacobian directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible,
!        DLSODE will compute it internally by difference quotients (MF =
!        22 or 25).  If you are supplying the Jacobian, write a
!        subroutine of the form
!
!           SUBROUTINE  JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
!           INTEGER  NEQ, ML, MU, NRWOPD
!           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
!
!        which provides df/dy by loading PD as follows:
!        - For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
!          the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore
!          the ML and MU arguments in this case.)
!        - For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
!          df(i)/dy(j); i.e., load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the
!          rows of PD from the top down.
!        - In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
!
!     d. Write a main program that calls subroutine DLSODE once for each
!        point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
!        for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
!        by DLSODE.
!
!        Before the first call to DLSODE, set ISTATE = 1, set Y and T to
!        the initial values, and set TOUT to the first output point.  To
!        continue the integration after a successful return, simply
!        reset TOUT and call DLSODE again.  No other parameters need be
!        reset.
!
! *Examples:
!     The following is a simple example problem, with the coding needed
!     for its solution by DLSODE. The problem is from chemical kinetics,
!     and consists of the following three rate equations:
!
!        dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.E4*y2*y3
!        dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.E4*y2*y3 - 3.E7*y2**2
!        dy3/dt = 3.E7*y2**2
!
!     on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.E10, with initial conditions
!     y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0. The problem is stiff.
!
!     The following coding solves this problem with DLSODE, using 
!     MF = 21 and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.E10.  It uses 
!     ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than for y1 or y3 because y2 
!     has much smaller values.  At the end of the run, statistical 
!     quantities of interest are printed.

!
! *Accuracy:
!     The accuracy of the solution depends on the choice of tolerances
!     RTOL and ATOL.  Actual (global) errors may exceed these local
!     tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
!
! *Cautions:
!     The work arrays should not be altered between calls to DLSODE for
!     the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and optional
!     inputs.
!
! *Portability:
!     Since NEQ is dimensioned inside DLSODE, some compilers may object
!     to a call to DLSODE with NEQ a scalar variable.  In this event, 
!     use DIMENSION NEQ(1).  Similar remarks apply to RTOL and ATOL.
!
!     Note to Cray users:
!     For maximum efficiency, use the CFT77 compiler.  Appropriate
!     compiler optimization directives have been inserted for CFT77.

!
! *Long Description:
!     The following complete description of the user interface to
!     DLSODE consists of four parts:
!
!     1.  The call sequence to subroutine DLSODE, which is a driver
!         routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!         the call sequence arguments and user-supplied routines.
!         Following these descriptions is a description of optional
!         inputs available through the call sequence, and then a
!         description of optional outputs in the work arrays.
!
!     2.  Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODE package that may
!         be (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability
!         to alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!         COMMON, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
!     3.  Descriptions of COMMON block to be declared in overlay or
!         similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!         of the problem and continued solution later.
!
!     4.  Description of two routines in the DLSODE package, either of
!         which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
!         These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!
!                         Part 1.  Call Sequence
!                         ----------------------
!
!     Arguments
!     ---------
!     The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!
!        F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
!
!     and those used for both input and output are
!
!        Y, T, ISTATE.
!
!     The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
!     optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here
!     refers to the return from subroutine DLSODE to the user's calling
!     program.)
!
!     The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
!     initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
!     change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
!     The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
!     F        The name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the ODE
!              system.  The system must be put in the first-order form
!              dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function of
!              the scalar t and the vector y. Subroutine F is to compute
!              the function f. It is to have the form
!
!                 SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!                 DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!
!              where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT =
!              f(T,Y) is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!              Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).  F must be
!              declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
!
!              Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!              NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),..., if NEQ is an array
!              (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!              See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!              If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!              externally to DLSODE, an extra call to F should be made
!              for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!              If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY
!              instead.
!
!     NEQ      The size of the ODE system (number of first-order
!              ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!              NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the
!              problem.  If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input),
!              the remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed,
!              if these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
!
!              Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred
!              to as a scalar in this user interface description.
!              However, NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the
!              system size.  (The DLSODE package accesses only NEQ(1).)
!              In either case, this parameter is passed as the NEQ
!              argument in all calls to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an
!              array, locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other
!              integer data and pass it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines
!              F and/or JAC must include NEQ in a DIMENSION statement
!              in that case.
!
!     Y        A real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!              length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on
!              the first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on
!              other calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the
!              vector of initial values.  On output, Y contains the
!              computed solution vector, evaluated at T. If desired,
!              the Y array may be used for other purposes between
!              calls to the solver.
!
!              This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F
!              and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!              Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!              pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODE package accesses
!              only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
!     T        The independent variable.  On input, T is used only on
!              the first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!              On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!              computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as
!              TOUT).  On an error return, T is the farthest point
!              reached.
!
!     TOUT     The next value of T at which a computed solution is
!              desired.  Used only for input.
!
!              When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!              to T for one call, then should not equal T for the next
!              call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .NE. T
!              is used in order to determine the direction of the
!              integration (i.e., the algebraic sign of the step sizes)
!              and the rough scale of the problem.  Integration in
!              either direction (forward or backward in T) is permitted.
!
!              If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored
!              after the first call (i.e., the first call with
!              TOUT .NE. T).  Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!              If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!              monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!              to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!              TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" below for
!              TCUR and HU.)
!
!
!     ITOL     An indicator for the type of error control.  See
!              description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
!     RTOL     A relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!              an array of length NEQ.  See description below under
!              ATOL.  Input only.
!
!     ATOL     An absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!              an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!              The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine the
!              error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!              control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
!              in Y, according to an inequality of the form
!
!                 rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) ) <= 1,
!
!              where
!
!                 EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!
!              and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!
!                 rms-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).
!
!              Here EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of weights which must
!              always be positive, and the values of RTOL and ATOL
!              should all be nonnegative.  The following table gives the
!              types (scalar/array) of RTOL and ATOL, and the
!              corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!              ITOL    RTOL      ATOL      EWT(i)
!              ----    ------    ------    -----------------------------
!              1       scalar    scalar    RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2       scalar    array     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3       array     scalar    RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4       array     array     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!              When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!              be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!              If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!              fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!              error controls can be obtained by substituting
!              user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!              the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!              If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!              run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!              components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e., of EWT) should be
!              scaled down uniformly.
!
!     ITASK    An index specifying the task to be performed.  Input
!              only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings:
!              1   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!                  t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!              2   Take one step only and return.
!              3   Stop at the first internal mesh point at or beyond
!                  t = TOUT and return.
!              4   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!                  t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.  TCRIT
!                  must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to or
!                  beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!                  integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!                  has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!              5   Take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!                  TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!              Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!              (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!              indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before
!              TCRIT, in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned
!              first).
!
!     ISTATE   An index used for input and output to specify the state
!              of the calculation.
!
!              On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows:
!              1   This is the first call for the problem
!                  (initializations will be done).  See "Note" below.
!              2   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
!                  continue normally, with no change in any input
!                  parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.  (If ITOL,
!                  RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls with
!                  ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!                  tested for legality.)
!              3   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
!                  continue normally, but with a change in input
!                  parameters other than TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are
!                  allowed in NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
!                  ML, MU, and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!                  (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
!
!              Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted as
!              a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!              input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!              purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)  Thus the
!              first call for which TOUT .NE. T requires ISTATE = 1 on
!              input.
!
!              On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings:
!               1  Nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
!                  ISTATE = 1 on input.
!               2  The integration was performed successfully.
!              -1  An excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP steps)
!                  was done on this call, before completing the
!                  requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!                  successful as far as T. (MXSTEP is an optional input
!                  and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!                  simply reset ISTATE to a value >1 and call again (the
!                  excess work step counter will be reset to 0).  In
!                  addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid this
!                  error return; see "Optional Inputs" below.
!              -2  Too much accuracy was requested for the precision of
!                  the machine being used.  This was detected before
!                  completing the requested task, but the integration
!                  was successful as far as T. To continue, the
!                  tolerance parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must
!                  be set to 3. The optional output TOLSF may be used
!                  for this purpose.  (Note:  If this condition is
!                  detected before taking any steps, then an illegal
!                  input return (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!              -3  Illegal input was detected, before taking any
!                  integration steps.  See written message for details.
!                  (Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of
!                  calls to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!                  the run to stop.)
!              -4  There were repeated error-test failures on one
!                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,
!                  but the integration was successful as far as T.  The
!                  problem may have a singularity, or the input may be
!                  inappropriate.
!              -5  There were repeated convergence-test failures on one
!                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,
!                  but the integration was successful as far as T. This
!                  may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix, if
!                  one is being used.
!              -6  EWT(i) became zero for some i during the integration.
!                  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0) was
!                  requested on a variable which has now vanished.  The
!                  integration was successful as far as T.
!
!              Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2, it
!              does not need to be reset for normal continuation.  Also,
!              since a negative input value of ISTATE will be regarded
!              as illegal, a negative output value requires the user to
!              change it, and possibly other inputs, before calling the
!              solver again.
!
!     IOPT     An integer flag to specify whether any optional inputs
!              are being used on this call.  Input only.  The optional
!              inputs are listed under a separate heading below.
!              0   No optional inputs are being used.  Default values
!                  will be used in all cases.
!              1   One or more optional inputs are being used.
!
!     RWORK    A real working array (double precision).  The length of
!              RWORK must be at least
!
!                 20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM
!
!              where
!                 NYH = the initial value of NEQ,
!              MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                       smaller value is given as an optional input),
!                 LWM = 0           if MITER = 0,
!                 LWM = NEQ**2 + 2  if MITER = 1 or 2,
!                 LWM = NEQ + 2     if MITER = 3, and
!                 LWM = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2
!                                   if MITER = 4 or 5.
!              (See the MF description below for METH and MITER.)
!
!              Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
!              this length is:
!              20 + 16*NEQ                    for MF = 10,
!              22 + 16*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 11 or 12,
!              22 + 17*NEQ                    for MF = 13,
!              22 + 17*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 14 or 15,
!              20 +  9*NEQ                    for MF = 20,
!              22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
!              22 + 10*NEQ                    for MF = 23,
!              22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
!
!              The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!              and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!              The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!              RWORK(1) = TCRIT, the critical value of t which the
!                         solver is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK
!                         is 4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  See ITASK.
!
!     LRW      The length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!              (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
!     IWORK    An integer work array.  Its length must be at least
!              20       if MITER = 0 or 3 (MF = 10, 13, 20, 23), or
!              20 + NEQ otherwise (MF = 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25).
!              (See the MF description below for MITER.)  The first few
!              words of IWORK are used for conditional and optional
!              inputs and optional outputs.
!
!              The following two words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
!              IWORK(1) = ML   These are the lower and upper half-
!              IWORK(2) = MU   bandwidths, respectively, of the banded
!                              Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
!                         The band is defined by the matrix locations
!                         (i,j) with i - ML <= j <= i + MU. ML and MU
!                         must satisfy 0 <= ML,MU <= NEQ - 1. These are
!                         required if MITER is 4 or 5, and ignored
!                         otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be the band
!                         parameters for a matrix to which df/dy is only
!                         approximately equal.
!
!     LIW      The length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!              (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
!     Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODE
!     for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
!     optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
!     The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
!     available for use by the user outside DLSODE between calls, if
!     desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
!
!     JAC      The name of the user-supplied routine (MITER = 1 or 4) to
!              compute the Jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of the
!              scalar t and the vector y.  (See the MF description below
!              for MITER.)  It is to have the form
!
!                 SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
!                 DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
!
!              where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the
!              array PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives
!              (elements of the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be
!              given a first dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same
!              meaning as in subroutine F.
!
!              In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU are
!              ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
!              columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
!
!              In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements within
!              the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise manner,
!              with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows of PD.
!              Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).  ML
!              and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
!              The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
!              correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
!              or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODE.
!
!              JAC need not provide df/dy exactly. A crude approximation
!              (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
!
!              In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver, so
!              that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!              Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
!              arguments NEQ, T, and Y. Thus to gain some efficiency,
!              intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may
!              be saved in a user COMMON block by F and not recomputed
!              by JAC, if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if
!              desired.  JAC must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling
!              program.
!
!              Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!              NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!              (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding
!              NEQ(1).  See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
!     MF       The method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values
!              of MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
!              and 25.  MF has decimal digits METH and MITER:
!                 MF = 10*METH + MITER .
!
!              METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!              1   Implicit Adams method.
!              2   Method based on backward differentiation formulas
!                  (BDF's).
!
!              MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!              0   Functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix is
!                  involved).
!              1   Chord iteration with a user-supplied full (NEQ by
!                  NEQ) Jacobian.
!              2   Chord iteration with an internally generated
!                  (difference quotient) full Jacobian (using NEQ
!                  extra calls to F per df/dy value).
!              3   Chord iteration with an internally generated
!                  diagonal Jacobian approximation (using one extra call
!                  to F per df/dy evaluation).
!              4   Chord iteration with a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
!              5   Chord iteration with an internally generated banded
!                  Jacobian (using ML + MU + 1 extra calls to F per
!                  df/dy evaluation).
!
!              If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine JAC
!              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!              For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.
!
!     Optional Inputs
!     ---------------
!     The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
!     call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
!     this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
!     location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
!     The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that case
!     all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any of
!     these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
!     Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
!     locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively,
!     and then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
!     Name    Location   Meaning and default value
!     ------  ---------  -----------------------------------------------
!     H0      RWORK(5)   Step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                        The default value is determined by the solver.
!     HMAX    RWORK(6)   Maximum absolute step size allowed.  The
!                        default value is infinite.
!     HMIN    RWORK(7)   Minimum absolute step size allowed.  The
!                        default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                        enforced on the final step before reaching
!                        TCRIT when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!     MAXORD  IWORK(5)   Maximum order to be allowed.  The default value
!                        is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2. (See the
!                        MF description above for METH.)  If MAXORD
!                        exceeds the default value, it will be reduced
!                        to the default value.  If MAXORD is changed
!                        during the problem, it may cause the current
!                        order to be reduced.
!     MXSTEP  IWORK(6)   Maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                        allowed during one call to the solver.  The
!                        default value is 500.
!     MXHNIL  IWORK(7)   Maximum number of messages printed (per
!                        problem) warning that T + H = T on a step
!                        (H = step size).  This must be positive to
!                        result in a nondefault value.  The default
!                        value is 10.
!
!     Optional Outputs
!     ----------------
!     As optional additional output from DLSODE, the variables listed
!     below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODE which 
!     are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of the
!     work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown. 
!     Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined on
!     any successful return from DLSODE, and on any return with ISTATE =
!     -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return (ISTATE = -3),
!     they will be unchanged from their existing values (if any), except
!     possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.  On any error return,
!     outputs relevant to the error will be defined, as noted below.
!
!     Name   Location   Meaning
!     -----  ---------  ------------------------------------------------
!     HU     RWORK(11)  Step size in t last used (successfully).
!     HCUR   RWORK(12)  Step size to be attempted on the next step.
!     TCUR   RWORK(13)  Current value of the independent variable which
!                       the solver has actually reached, i.e., the
!                       current internal mesh point in t. On output,
!                       TCUR will always be at least as far as the
!                       argument T, but may be farther (if interpolation
!                       was done).
!     TOLSF  RWORK(14)  Tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                       computed when a request for too much accuracy
!                       was detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the
!                       start of the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).
!                       If ITOL is left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are
!                       uniformly scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the
!                       next call, then the solver is deemed likely to
!                       succeed.  (The user may also ignore TOLSF and
!                       alter the tolerance parameters in any other way
!                       appropriate.)
!     NST    IWORK(11)  Number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!     NFE    IWORK(12)  Number of F evaluations for the problem so far.
!     NJE    IWORK(13)  Number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix LU
!                       decompositions) for the problem so far.
!     NQU    IWORK(14)  Method order last used (successfully).
!     NQCUR  IWORK(15)  Order to be attempted on the next step.
!     IMXER  IWORK(16)  Index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                       the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                       on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!     LENRW  IWORK(17)  Length of RWORK actually required.  This is
!                       defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                       input return for insufficient storage.
!     LENIW  IWORK(18)  Length of IWORK actually required.  This is
!                       defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                       input return for insufficient storage.
!
!     The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which may
!     also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.  For each
!     array, the table below gives its internal name, its base address
!     in RWORK, and its description.
!
!     Name  Base address  Description
!     ----  ------------  ----------------------------------------------
!     YH    21            The Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                         (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value of
!                         NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j + 1 of
!                         YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times the jth
!                         derivative of the interpolating polynomial
!                         currently representing the solution, evaluated
!                         at t = TCUR.
!     ACOR  LENRW-NEQ+1   Array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!                         corrections on each step, scaled on output to
!                         represent the estimated local error in Y on
!                         the last step.  This is the vector e in the
!                         description of the error control.  It is
!                         defined only on successful return from DLSODE.
!
!
!                    Part 2.  Other Callable Routines
!                    --------------------------------
!
!     The following are optional calls which the user may make to gain
!     additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODE.
!
!     Form of call              Function
!     ------------------------  ----------------------------------------
!     CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                               output of messages from DLSODE, if the
!                               default is not desired.  The default
!                               value of LUN is 6. This call may be made
!                               at any time and will take effect
!                               immediately.
!     CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                               messages by DLSODE.  MFLAG = 0 means do
!                               not print.  (Danger:  this risks losing
!                               valuable information.)  MFLAG = 1 means
!                               print (the default).  This call may be
!                               made at any time and will take effect
!                               immediately.
!     CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB)  Saves and restores the contents of the
!                               internal COMMON blocks used by DLSODE
!                               (see Part 3 below).  RSAV must be a

!                               successful return from DLSODE.  Detailed
!                               instructions follow.
!
!     Detailed instructions for using DINTDY
!     --------------------------------------
!     The form of the CALL is:
!
!           CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
!     The input parameters are:
!
!     T          Value of independent variable where answers are
!                desired (normally the same as the T last returned by
!                DLSODE).  For valid results, T must lie between
!                TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" above
!                for TCUR and HU.)
!     K          Integer order of the derivative desired.  K must
!                satisfy 0 <= K <= NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current
!                order (see "Optional Outputs").  The capability
!                corresponding to K = 0, i.e., computing y(t), is
!                already provided by DLSODE directly.  Since
!                NQCUR >= 1, the first derivative dy/dt is always
!                available with DINTDY.
!     RWORK(21)  The base address of the history array YH.
!     NYH        Column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
!     The output parameters are:
!
!     DKY        Real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!                of the Kth derivative of y(t).
!     IFLAG      Integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!                -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!                On an error return, a message is also written.
!
!
!                          Part 3.  Common Blocks
!                          ----------------------
!
!     If DLSODE is to be used in an overlay situation, the user must
!     declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!     (1) the call sequence to DLSODE,
!     (2) the internal COMMON block /DLS001/, of length 255 
!         (218 double precision words followed by 37 integer words).
!
!     If DLSODE is used on a system in which the contents of internal
!     COMMON blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
!     declare the above COMMON block in his main program to insure that
!     its contents are preserved.
!
!     If the solution of a given problem by DLSODE is to be interrupted
!     and then later continued, as when restarting an interrupted run or
!     alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
!     following the return from the last DLSODE call prior to the
!     interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
!     internal COMMON block, and later restore these values before the
!     next DLSODE call for that problem.   In addition, if XSETUN and/or
!     XSETF was called for non-default handling of error messages, then
!     these calls must be repeated.  To save and restore the COMMON
!     block, use subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
!
!
!              Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines
!              -----------------------------------------------
!
!     Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODE package which
!     relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
!     replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since
!     such a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it
!     should be done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great
!     caution.  (Note:  The means by which the package version of a
!     routine is superseded by the user's version may be system-
!     dependent.)
!
!     DEWSET
!     ------
!     The following subroutine is called just before each internal
!     integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
!     described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!
!           SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
!
!     where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODE call
!     sequence, YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector,
!     and EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
!     If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
!     (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
!     in Y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
!     DVNORM routine (see below), and also used by DLSODE in the
!     computation of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian
!     approximation, and the increments for difference quotient
!     Jacobians.
!
!     In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
!     the current values of derivatives of y. Derivatives up to order NQ
!     are available from the history array YH, described above under
!     optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
!     extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
!     factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
!     given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
!     NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
!     can be obtained by including in SEWSET the statements:
!           DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!           NQ = ILS(33)
!           NST = ILS(34)
!           H = RLS(212)
!     Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
!     YCUR(NYH+i)/H (i=1,...,NEQ) (and the division by H is unnecessary
!     when NST = 0).
!
!     DVNORM
!     ------
!     DVNORM is a real function routine which computes the weighted
!     root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!
!        d = DVNORM (n, v, w)
!
!     where:
!     n = the length of the vector,
!     v = real array of length n containing the vector,
!     w = real array of length n containing weights,
!     d = SQRT( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 ).
!
!     DVNORM is called with n = NEQ and with w(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
!     EWT is as set by subroutine DEWSET.
!
!     If the user supplies this function, it should return a nonnegative
!     value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODE.
!     None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.  For example, a
!     user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!     - Substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or
!     - Ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of
!       suppressing the error control on those components of Y.

! This is the 12 November 2003 version of
! DLSODES: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations
!          with general Sparse Jacobian matrix.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODES solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
! DLSODES is a variant of the DLSODE package, and is intended for
! problems in which the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an arbitrary
! sparse structure (when the problem is stiff).

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODES package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
! which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!
! B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
! Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
! whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
! reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
! use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, there are two standard
! choices for the method flag, MF = 121 and MF = 222.  In both cases,
! DLSODES requires the Jacobian matrix in some form, and it treats this
! matrix in general sparse form, with sparsity structure determined
! internally.  (For options where the user supplies the sparsity
! structure, see the full description of MF below.)
!
! C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
! directly (MF = 121), but if this is not feasible, DLSODES will
! compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 222).
! If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
! Here NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to
! load the array PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of df/dy.
! I.e., load PDJ(i) with df(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.
! The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal situations.
! DLSODES will call the JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
! Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  Usually, a crude approximation
! to df/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elements, will suffice.
!
! D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODES once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
! DLSODES.  On the first call to DLSODES, supply arguments as follows:
! F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable t.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             20 + 16*NEQ            for MF = 10,
!             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
!                                    for MF = 121 or 222,
!          where:
!          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
!                   Jacobian (if this is unknown, use an estimate), and
!          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
!                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
!          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
!          be predicted in advance if MF = 121 or 222, and the value
!          above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.  Some
!          experimentation with this size may be necessary.
!          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
!          output, available in IWORK(17).)
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user dimension).
! JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 121).
!          If used, this name must be declared External in calling
!          program.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          10  for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used
!          121 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied sparse Jacobian
!          222 for stiff method, internally generated sparse Jacobian
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2  if DLSODES was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
!             CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
!          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 may result from using
!          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
!          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
!          DLSODES again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
!          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
!
! F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSODES again.  No other parameters need be reset.

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example Problem.
!
! The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
! needed for its solution by DLSODES.  The problem is from chemical
! kinetics, and consists of the following 12 rate equations:
!    dy1/dt  = -rk1*y1
!    dy2/dt  = rk1*y1 + rk11*rk14*y4 + rk19*rk14*y5
!                - rk3*y2*y3 - rk15*y2*y12 - rk2*y2
!    dy3/dt  = rk2*y2 - rk5*y3 - rk3*y2*y3 - rk7*y10*y3
!                + rk11*rk14*y4 + rk12*rk14*y6
!    dy4/dt  = rk3*y2*y3 - rk11*rk14*y4 - rk4*y4
!    dy5/dt  = rk15*y2*y12 - rk19*rk14*y5 - rk16*y5
!    dy6/dt  = rk7*y10*y3 - rk12*rk14*y6 - rk8*y6
!    dy7/dt  = rk17*y10*y12 - rk20*rk14*y7 - rk18*y7
!    dy8/dt  = rk9*y10 - rk13*rk14*y8 - rk10*y8
!    dy9/dt  = rk4*y4 + rk16*y5 + rk8*y6 + rk18*y7
!    dy10/dt = rk5*y3 + rk12*rk14*y6 + rk20*rk14*y7
!                + rk13*rk14*y8 - rk7*y10*y3 - rk17*y10*y12
!                - rk6*y10 - rk9*y10
!    dy11/dt = rk10*y8
!    dy12/dt = rk6*y10 + rk19*rk14*y5 + rk20*rk14*y7
!                - rk15*y2*y12 - rk17*y10*y12
!
! with rk1 = rk5 = 0.1,  rk4 = rk8 = rk16 = rk18 = 2.5,
!      rk10 = 5.0,  rk2 = rk6 = 10.0,  rk14 = 30.0,
!      rk3 = rk7 = rk9 = rk11 = rk12 = rk13 = rk19 = rk20 = 50.0,
!      rk15 = rk17 = 100.0.
!
! The t interval is from 0 to 1000, and the initial conditions
! are y1 = 1, y2 = y3 = ... = y12 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
!
! The following coding solves this problem with DLSODES, using MF = 121
! and printing results at t = .1, 1., 10., 100., 1000.  It uses
! ITOL = 1 and mixed relative/absolute tolerance controls.
! During the run and at the end, statistical quantities of interest
! are printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODES.
!
! The user interface to DLSODES consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODES, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODES package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODES package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODES to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!          Subroutine F should not alter y(1),...,y(NEQ).
!          F must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODES, an extra call to F should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODES package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
!          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
!          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
!          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!          on the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
!          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODES package accesses only
!          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!          in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          the state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem
!             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
!             the conditional inputs IA and JA,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!             In particular, if MITER = 1 or 2, a call with ISTATE = 3
!             will cause the sparsity structure of the problem to be
!             recomputed (or reread from IA and JA if MOSS = 0).
!          Note:  a preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
!              if one is being used.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means a fatal error return flag came from the sparse
!              solver CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS (numerical
!              factorization or backsolve).  This should never happen.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!
!          Note: an error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 and with
!          MITER = 1 or 2 may mean that the sparsity structure of the
!          problem has changed significantly since it was last
!          determined (or input).  In that case, one can attempt to
!          complete the integration by setting ISTATE = 3 on the next
!          call, so that a new structure determination is done.
!
!          Note:  since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a work array used for a mixture of real (double precision)
!          and integer work space.
!          The length of RWORK (in real words) must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LWM = 0                                    if MITER = 0,
!          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+9*NEQ)/LENRAT   if MITER = 1,
!          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+10*NEQ)/LENRAT  if MITER = 2,
!          LWM = NEQ + 2                              if MITER = 3.
!          In the above formulas,
!          NNZ    = number of nonzero elements in the Jacobian matrix.
!          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
!                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
!          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
!          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
!          the minimum length of RWORK is:
!             20 + 16*NEQ        for MF = 10,
!             20 + 16*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 11, 111, 211, 12, 112, 212,
!             22 + 17*NEQ        for MF = 13,
!             20 +  9*NEQ        for MF = 20,
!             20 +  9*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 21, 121, 221, 22, 122, 222,
!             22 + 10*NEQ        for MF = 23.
!          If MITER = 1 or 2, the above formula for LWM is only a
!          crude lower bound.  The required length of RWORK cannot
!          be readily predicted in general, as it depends on the
!          sparsity structure of the problem.  Some experimentation
!          may be necessary.
!
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!             31 + NEQ + NNZ   if MOSS = 0 and MITER = 1 or 2, or
!             30               otherwise.
!          (NNZ is the number of nonzero elements in df/dy.)
!
!          In DLSODES, IWORK is used only for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following two blocks of words in IWORK are conditional
!          inputs, required if MOSS = 0 and MITER = 1 or 2, but not
!          otherwise (see the description of MF for MOSS).
!            IWORK(30+j) = IA(j)     (j=1,...,NEQ+1)
!            IWORK(31+NEQ+k) = JA(k) (k=1,...,NNZ)
!          The two arrays IA and JA describe the sparsity structure
!          to be assumed for the Jacobian matrix.  JA contains the row
!          indices where nonzero elements occur, reading in columnwise
!          order, and IA contains the starting locations in JA of the
!          descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in that order, with
!          IA(1) = 1.  Thus, for each column index j = 1,...,NEQ, the
!          values of the row index i in column j where a nonzero
!          element may occur are given by
!            i = JA(k),  where   IA(j) .le. k .lt. IA(j+1).
!          If NNZ is the total number of nonzero locations assumed,
!          then the length of the JA array is NNZ, and IA(NEQ+1) must
!          be NNZ + 1.  Duplicate entries are not allowed.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODES
! for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODES between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
!
! JAC    = name of user-supplied routine (MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1) to
!          compute the Jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of
!          the scalar t and the vector y.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, and JAN are input, and the array
!          PDJ, of length NEQ, is to be loaded with column J
!          of the Jacobian on output.  Thus df(i)/dy(J) is to be
!          loaded into PDJ(i) for all relevant values of i.
!          Here T and Y have the same meaning as in Subroutine F,
!          and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).  IAN and JAN are
!          undefined in calls to JAC for structure determination
!          (MOSS = 1).  otherwise, IAN and JAN are structure
!          descriptors, as defined under optional outputs below, and
!          so can be used to determine the relevant row indices i, if
!          desired.
!               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
!          approximation (possibly with greater sparsity) will do.
!               In any case, PDJ is preset to zero by the solver,
!          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!          Calls to JAC are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that order, and
!          each such set of calls is preceded by a call to F with the
!          same arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
!          if desired.  JAC must not alter its input arguments.
!          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.
!          MF has three decimal digits-- MOSS, METH, MITER--
!             MF = 100*MOSS + 10*METH + MITER.
!          MOSS indicates the method to be used to obtain the sparsity
!          structure of the Jacobian matrix if MITER = 1 or 2:
!            MOSS = 0 means the user has supplied IA and JA
!                     (see descriptions under IWORK above).
!            MOSS = 1 means the user has supplied JAC (see below)
!                     and the structure will be obtained from NEQ
!                     initial calls to JAC.
!            MOSS = 2 means the structure will be obtained from NEQ+1
!                     initial calls to F.
!          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
!          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix
!                      is involved).
!            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
!                      sparse Jacobian, given by Subroutine JAC.
!            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
!                      generated (difference quotient) sparse Jacobian
!                      (using NGP extra calls to F per df/dy value,
!                      where NGP is an optional output described below.)
!            MITER = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
!                      generated diagonal Jacobian approximation
!                      (using 1 extra call to F per df/dy evaluation).
!          If MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1, the user must supply a Subroutine
!          JAC (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!          Otherwise, a dummy argument can be used.
!
!          The standard choices for MF are:
!            MF = 10  for a nonstiff problem,
!            MF = 21 or 22 for a stiff problem with IA/JA supplied
!                     (21 if JAC is supplied, 22 if not),
!            MF = 121 for a stiff problem with JAC supplied,
!                     but not IA/JA,
!            MF = 222 for a stiff problem with neither IA/JA nor
!                     JAC supplied.
!          The sparseness structure can be changed during the
!          problem by making a call to DLSODES with ISTATE = 3.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! SETH    RWORK(8)  the element threshhold for sparsity determination
!                   when MOSS = 1 or 2.  If the absolute value of
!                   an estimated Jacobian element is .le. SETH, it
!                   will be assumed to be absent in the structure.
!                   The default value of SETH is 0.
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODES, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODES
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODES, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far,
!                   excluding those for structure determination
!                   (MOSS = 2).
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations for the problem
!                   so far, excluding those for structure determination
!                   (MOSS = 1).
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! NNZ     IWORK(19) the number of nonzero elements in the Jacobian
!                   matrix, including the diagonal (MITER = 1 or 2).
!                   (This may differ from that given by IA(NEQ+1)-1
!                   if MOSS = 0, because of added diagonal entries.)
!
! NGP     IWORK(20) the number of groups of column indices, used in
!                   difference quotient Jacobian aproximations if
!                   MITER = 2.  This is also the number of extra f
!                   evaluations needed for each Jacobian evaluation.
!
! NLU     IWORK(21) the number of sparse LU decompositions for the
!                   problem so far.
!
! LYH     IWORK(22) the base address in RWORK of the history array YH,
!                   described below in this list.
!
! IPIAN   IWORK(23) the base address of the structure descriptor array
!                   IAN, described below in this list.
!
! IPJAN   IWORK(24) the base address of the structure descriptor array
!                   JAN, described below in this list.
!
! NZL     IWORK(25) the number of nonzero elements in the strict lower
!                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
!                   iteration (MITER = 1 or 2).
!
! NZU     IWORK(26) the number of nonzero elements in the strict upper
!                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
!                   iteration (MITER = 1 or 2).
!                   The total number of nonzeros in the factorization
!                   is therefore NZL + NZU + NEQ.
!
! The following four arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address, and its description.
! For YH and ACOR, the base addresses are in RWORK (a real array).
! The integer arrays IAN and JAN are to be obtained by declaring an
! integer array IWK and identifying IWK(1) with RWORK(21), using either
! an equivalence statement or a subroutine call.  Then the base
! addresses IPIAN (of IAN) and IPJAN (of JAN) in IWK are to be obtained
! as optional outputs IWORK(23) and IWORK(24), respectively.
! Thus IAN(1) is IWK(IPIAN), etc.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! IAN    IPIAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NEQ + 1.
! JAN    IPJAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NNZ.
!         (see above)    IAN and JAN together describe the sparsity
!                        structure of the Jacobian matrix, as used by
!                        DLSODES when MITER = 1 or 2.
!                        JAN contains the row indices of the nonzero
!                        locations, reading in columnwise order, and
!                        IAN contains the starting locations in JAN of
!                        the descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in
!                        that order, with IAN(1) = 1.  Thus for each
!                        j = 1,...,NEQ, the row indices i of the
!                        nonzero locations in column j are
!                        i = JAN(k),  IAN(j) .le. k .lt. IAN(j+1).
!                        Note that IAN(NEQ+1) = NNZ + 1.
!                        (If MOSS = 0, IAN/JAN may differ from the
!                        input IA/JA because of a different ordering
!                        in each column, and added diagonal entries.)
!
! YH      LYH            the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!          (optional     (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!           output)      of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.  The base address LYH
!                        is another optional output, listed above.

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODES.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODES, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODES.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCMS(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODES (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 224
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 71 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCMS is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODES.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODES.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   LYH = IWORK(22)
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODES).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (See optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!             by DLSODES directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
!             as an optional output as shown above.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODES is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODES, and
!   (2) the two internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
!                      followed by 34 integer words),
!
! If DLSODES is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODES is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODES call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODES call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODES package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODES call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSODES in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
! and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODES.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Other routines in the DLSODES package.
!
! In addition to Subroutine DLSODES, the DLSODES package includes the
! following subroutines and function routines:
!  DIPREP   acts as an iterface between DLSODES and DPREP, and also does
!           adjusting of work space pointers and work arrays.
!  DPREP    is called by DIPREP to compute sparsity and do sparse matrix
!           preprocessing if MITER = 1 or 2.
!  JGROUP   is called by DPREP to compute groups of Jacobian column
!           indices for use when MITER = 2.
!  ADJLR    adjusts the length of required sparse matrix work space.
!           It is called by DPREP.
!  CNTNZU   is called by DPREP and counts the nonzero elements in the
!           strict upper triangle of J + J-transpose, where J = df/dy.
!  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
!  DSTODE   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
!           integration and the associated error control.
!  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
!  DPRJS    computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = df/dy
!           and the Newton iteration matrix P = I - h*l0*J.
!  DSOLSS   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
!  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
!  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
!  DSRCMS   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
!           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
!  ODRV     constructs a reordering of the rows and columns of
!           a matrix by the minimum degree algorithm.  ODRV is a
!           driver routine which calls Subroutines MD, MDI, MDM,
!           MDP, MDU, and SRO.  See Ref. 2 for details.  (The ODRV
!           module has been modified since Ref. 2, however.)
!  CDRV     performs reordering, symbolic factorization, numerical
!           factorization, or linear system solution operations,
!           depending on a path argument ipath.  CDRV is a
!           driver routine which calls Subroutines NROC, NSFC,
!           NNFC, NNSC, and NNTC.  See Ref. 3 for details.
!           DLSODES uses CDRV to solve linear systems in which the
!           coefficient matrix is  P = I - con*J, where I is the
!           identity, con is a scalar, and J is an approximation to
!           the Jacobian df/dy.  Because CDRV deals with rowwise
!           sparsity descriptions, CDRV works with P-transpose, not P.
!  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
!  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
!           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
! Note:  DVNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function routines.
! All the others are subroutines.

! Compute required work array lengths, as far as possible, and test
! these against LRW and LIW.  Then set tentative pointers for work
! arrays.  Pointers to RWORK/IWORK segments are named by prefixing L to
! the name of the segment.  E.g., the segment YH starts at RWORK(LYH).
! Segments of RWORK (in order) are denoted  WM, YH, SAVF, EWT, ACOR.
! If MITER = 1 or 2, the required length of the matrix work space WM
! is not yet known, and so a crude minimum value is used for the
! initial tests of LRW and LIW, and YH is temporarily stored as far
! to the right in RWORK as possible, to leave the maximum amount
! of space for WM for matrix preprocessing.  Thus if MITER = 1 or 2
! and MOSS .ne. 2, some of the segments of RWORK are temporarily
! omitted, as they are not needed in the preprocessing.  These
! omitted segments are: ACOR if ISTATE = 1, EWT and ACOR if ISTATE = 3
! and MOSS = 1, and SAVF, EWT, and ACOR if ISTATE = 3 and MOSS = 0.

! This is the 12 November 2003 version of
! DLSODA: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
!         Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODA solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
!
! This a variant version of the DLSODE package.
! It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
! This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
! problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
! appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODA package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
! optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
! instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
! which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!
! B. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODA once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
! by DLSODA.  On the first call to DLSODA, supply arguments as follows:
! F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be less than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9).
!          See also Paragraph E below.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
!          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph E below.
! JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
!          See also Paragraph E below.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! C. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2  if DLSODA was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
!
! D. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSODA again.  No other parameters need be reset.
!
! E. Note: If and when DLSODA regards the problem as stiff, and
! switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
! Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
! inputs to DLSODA recommended in Paragraph B above cause DLSODA to
! treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
! difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
! matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
! array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
! J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
! argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
! RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.

! Example Problem.
!
! The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
! needed for its solution by DLSODA.  The problem is from chemical
! kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
!     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
!     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
!     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
! on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
! y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
!
! The following coding solves this problem with DLSODA,
! printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
! ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
! y2 has much smaller values.
! At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
! printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

! Full description of user interface to DLSODA.
!
! The user interface to DLSODA consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODA, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODA package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODA package,
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      this relates to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, JT,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODA to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
!          F must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODA, an extra call to F should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODA package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
!          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
!          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
!          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
!          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODA package accesses only
!          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!          For the initial t, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!          in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
!          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
!          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
!          See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          the state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem
!             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
!             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
!             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
!              if one is being used.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
!              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This happens when DLSODA chooses to switch methods
!              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
!          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
!          optional outputs.
!          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
!          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODA can either
!          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
!          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
!          program in response to output from DLSODA.
!
!                       --- Fixed Length Case ---
!          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
!               MAX (LRN, LRS),
!          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
!          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
!
!          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
!          as follows:
!          IF NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
!          their default values, then
!             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ,
!             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2           if JT = 1 or 2,
!             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ   if JT = 4 or 5.
!          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
!             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ,
!             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT,
!          where
!             NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!             MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
!                      optional input,
!             MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
!                      optional input,
!             LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
!             LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
!             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
!
!                       --- Dynamic Length Case ---
!          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
!          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
!          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
!          DLSODA starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return
!          from DLSODA, the optional output MCUR indicates the current
!          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the
!          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
!          DLSODA and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODA has switched
!          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK
!          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if
!          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required
!          if DLSODA returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
!          After resetting the length, call DLSODA with ISTATE = 3
!          to signal that change.
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer array for work space.
!          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
!          problem, between
!             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
!          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODA can
!          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
!          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
!          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
!          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
!          only be at least LIN = 20.
!
!          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
!            IWORK(1) = ML     these are the lower and upper
!            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
!                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
!                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
!                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
!                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
!                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and
!                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
!                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
!                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
! altered between calls to DLSODA for the same problem.
! The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
! between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODA between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
!          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
!          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
!          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
!          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
!          DLSODA compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
!          If and when DLSODA uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
!          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
!          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
!          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
!          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
!          and the vector y.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
!          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
!          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
!          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
!          Subroutine F.
!               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
!          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
!          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
!               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
!          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
!          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
!          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
!          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
!          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
!          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
!          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODA.
!               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
!          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
!               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
!          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
!          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
!          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
!          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
!          JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
!          treated, if and when DLSODA requires this matrix.
!          JT has the following values and meanings:
!           1 means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
!           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
!             Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
!           4 means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
!           5 means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
!             ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
!          If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
!          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!          If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! IXPR    IWORK(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
!                   IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
!                   IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
!                   T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
!                   unit as used for error messages.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!
! MXORDN  IWORK(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
!                   (Adams) method.  the default value is 12.
!                   if MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
!
! MXORDS  IWORK(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
!                   (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
!                   If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODA, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODA
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODA, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! TSW     RWORK(15) the value of t at the time of the last method
!                   switch, if any.
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
!                   LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
!                   that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
!                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
!                   that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
!                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! MUSED   IWORK(19) the method indicator for the last successful step:
!                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!
! MCUR    IWORK(20) the current method indicator:
!                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!                   This is the method to be attempted
!                   on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
!                   only if a method switch has just been made.
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at T = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LACOR         array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!         (from Common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
!           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
!                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
!                        the description of the error control.  It is
!                        defined only on a successful return from
!                        DLSODA.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
!                        including in the user's program the
!                        following 2 lines:
!                           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
!                           LACOR = ILS(22)

! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODA.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODA, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODA.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCMA(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODA (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 240
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 46 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCMA is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODA.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODA.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODA).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!             by DLSODA directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODA is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODA, and
!   (2) the two internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
!                      followed by  9 integer words).
!
! If DLSODA is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODA is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODA call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODA call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMA (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODA package which
! relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODA call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
! DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODA in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
! quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).

! This is the 12 November 2003 version of
! DLSODAR: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
!          Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems,
!          and with Root-finding.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODAR solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
! At the same time, it locates the roots of any of a set of functions
!     g(i) = g(i,t,y(1),...,y(NEQ))  (i = 1,...,ng).
!
! This a variant version of the DLSODE package.  It differs from it
! in two ways:
! (a) It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
! This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
! problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
! appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.
! (b) It finds the root of at least one of a set of constraint
! functions g(i) of the independent and dependent variables.
! It finds only those roots for which some g(i), as a function
! of t, changes sign in the interval of integration.
! It then returns the solution at the root, if that occurs
! sooner than the specified stop condition, and otherwise returns
! the solution according the specified stop condition.

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODAR package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
! optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
! instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
! which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!
! B. Provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
! which supplies the vector function g by loading GOUT(i) with
! g(i), the i-th constraint function whose root is sought.
!
! C. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODAR once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
! DLSODAR.  On the first call to DLSODAR, supply arguments as follows:
! F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be less than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9) + 3*NG.
!          See also Paragraph F below.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
!          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph F below.
! JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
!          See also Paragraph F below.
! G      = name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
!          roots are desired during the integration.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
!          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
! JROOT  = integer array of length NG for output of root information.
!          See next paragraph.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
! JROOT, and possibly ATOL.
!
! D. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable.  This is
!          TOUT if ISTATE = 2, or the root location if ISTATE = 3,
!          or the farthest point reached if DLSODAR was unsuccessful.
! ISTATE = 2 or 3  if DLSODAR was successful, negative otherwise.
!           2 means no root was found, and TOUT was reached as desired.
!           3 means a root was found prior to reaching TOUT.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
! JROOT  = array showing roots found if ISTATE = 3 on return.
!          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at t, or 0 otherwise.
!
! E. To continue the integration after a successful return, proceed
! as follows:
!  (a) If ISTATE = 2 on return, reset TOUT and call DLSODAR again.
!  (b) If ISTATE = 3 on return, reset ISTATE to 2, call DLSODAR again.
! In either case, no other parameters need be reset.
!
! F. Note: If and when DLSODAR regards the problem as stiff, and
! switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
! Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
! inputs to DLSODAR recommended in Paragraph C above cause DLSODAR to
! treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
! difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
! matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
! array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
! J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
! argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
! RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example Problem.
!
! The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
! needed for its solution by DLSODAR.  The problem is from chemical
! kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
!     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
!     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
!     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
! on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
! y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
! In addition, we want to find the values of t, y1, y2, and y3 at which
!   (1) y1 reaches the value 1.e-4, and
!   (2) y3 reaches the value 1.e-2.
!
! The following coding solves this problem with DLSODAR,
! printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10, and at the computed
! roots.  It uses ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3
! because y2 has much smaller values.
! At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
! printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODAR.
!
! The user interface to DLSODAR consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODAR, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODAR package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODAR package,
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      this relates to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC,
!     JT, G, and NG,
! that used only for output is  JROOT,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODAR to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
!          F must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODAR, an extra call to F should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODAR package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to F, JAC, and G.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
!          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
!          it to F, JAC, and G.  Each such subroutine must include
!          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F,
!          JAC, and G.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!          pass it to F, JAC, and G.  (The DLSODAR package accesses only
!          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          If a root was found, T is the computed location of the
!          root reached first, on output.
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!          in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
!          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
!          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
!          See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          the state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem
!             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
!             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
!             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
!             In addition, immediately following a return with
!             ISTATE = 3 (root found), NG and G may be changed.
!             (But changing NG from 0 to .gt. 0 is not allowed.)
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!           2  means the integration was performed successfully, and
!              no roots were found.
!           3  means the integration was successful, and one or more
!              roots were found before satisfying the stop condition
!              specified by ITASK.  See JROOT.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
!              if one is being used.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
!              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This happens when DLSODAR chooses to switch methods
!              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
!          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
!          optional outputs.
!          As DLSODAR switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
!          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODAR can either
!          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
!          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
!          program in response to output from DLSODAR.
!
!                       --- Fixed Length Case ---
!          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
!               max (LRN, LRS),
!          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
!          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
!
!          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
!          as follows:
!          If NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
!          their default values, then
!             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG,
!             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2 + 3*NG           (JT = 1 or 2),
!             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ + 3*NG   (JT = 4 or 5).
!          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
!             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ + 3*NG,
!             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT + 3*NG,
!          where
!             NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!             MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
!                      optional input,
!             MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
!                      optional input,
!             LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
!             LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
!             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
!
!                       --- Dynamic Length Case ---
!          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
!          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
!          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
!          DLSODAR starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return
!          from DLSODAR, the optional output MCUR indicates the current
!          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the
!          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
!          DLSODAR and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODAR has switched
!          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK
!          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if
!          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required
!          if DLSODAR returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
!          After resetting the length, call DLSODAR with ISTATE = 3
!          to signal that change.
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer array for work space.
!          As DLSODAR switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
!          problem, between
!             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
!          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODAR can
!          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
!          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
!          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
!          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
!          only be at least LIN = 20.
!
!          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
!            IWORK(1) = ML     These are the lower and upper
!            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
!                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
!                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
!                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
!                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
!                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and
!                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
!                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
!                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
! altered between calls to DLSODAR for the same problem.
! The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
! between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODAR between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by F, JAC, or G).
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
!          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
!          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
!          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
!          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
!          DLSODAR compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
!          If and when DLSODAR uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
!          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
!          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
!          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
!          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
!          and the vector y.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
!          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
!          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
!          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
!          Subroutine F.
!               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
!          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
!          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into pd(i,j).
!               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
!          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
!          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
!          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
!          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
!          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
!          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
!          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODAR.
!               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
!          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
!               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
!          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
!          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
!          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
!          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
!          JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
!          treated, if and when DLSODAR requires this matrix.
!          JT has the following values and meanings:
!           1 means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
!           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
!             Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
!           4 means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
!           5 means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
!             ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
!          If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
!          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!          If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
!
! G      = the name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
!          roots are desired during the integration.  It is to have
!          the form
!               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, and NG are input, and the array GOUT
!          is output.  NEQ, T, and Y have the same meaning as in
!          the F routine, and GOUT is an array of length NG.
!          For i = 1,...,NG, this routine is to load into GOUT(i)
!          the value at (T,Y) of the i-th constraint function g(i).
!          DLSODAR will find roots of the g(i) of odd multiplicity
!          (i.e. sign changes) as they occur during the integration.
!          G must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Caution:  Because of numerical errors in the functions
!          g(i) due to roundoff and integration error, DLSODAR may
!          return false roots, or return the same root at two or more
!          nearly equal values of t.  If such false roots are
!          suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances
!          and/or higher precision in the evaluation of the g(i).
!
!          If a root of some g(i) defines the end of the problem,
!          the input to DLSODAR should nevertheless allow integration
!          to a point slightly past that root, so that DLSODAR can
!          locate the root by interpolation.
!
!          Subroutine G may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in G) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
!          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
!
! JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Used only for output.
!          On a return with ISTATE = 3 (one or more roots found),
!          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at T, or JROOT(i) = 0 if not.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! IXPR    IWORK(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
!                   IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
!                   IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
!                   T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
!                   unit as used for error messages.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!
! MXORDN  IWORK(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
!                   (Adams) method.  The default value is 12.
!                   If MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
!
! MXORDS  IWORK(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
!                   (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
!                   If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODAR, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODAR
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODAR, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! TSW     RWORK(15) the value of t at the time of the last method
!                   switch, if any.
!
! NGE     IWORK(10) the number of g evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
!                   LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
!                   that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
!                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
!                   that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
!                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! MUSED   IWORK(19) the method indicator for the last successful step:
!                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!
! MCUR    IWORK(20) the current method indicator:
!                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!                   This is the method to be attempted
!                   on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
!                   only if a method switch has just been made.
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21 + 3*NG      the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LACOR         array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!         (from Common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
!           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
!                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
!                        the description of the error control.  It is
!                        defined only on a successful return from
!                        DLSODAR.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
!                        including in the user's program the
!                        following 2 lines:
!                           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
!                           LACOR = ILS(22)
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODAR.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODAR, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODAR.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCAR(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODAR (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 245
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 55 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCAR is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODAR.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODAR.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   LYH = 21 + 3*NG
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODAR).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
!             by DLSODAR directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! LYH       = 21 + 3*NG = base address in RWORK of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODAR is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODAR, and
!   (2) the three internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
!                      followed by  9 integer words).
!         /DLSR01/  of length   7  (3 double precision words
!                      followed by  4 integer words).
!
! If DLSODAR is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODAR is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODAR call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODAR call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCAR (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODAR package which
! relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODAR call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
! DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODAR in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
! quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).

! Other routines in the DLSODAR package.
!
! In addition to Subroutine DLSODAR, the DLSODAR package includes the
! following subroutines and function routines:
!  DRCHEK   does preliminary checking for roots, and serves as an
!           interface between Subroutine DLSODAR and Subroutine DROOTS.
!  DROOTS   finds the leftmost root of a set of functions.
!  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
!  DSTODA   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
!           integration and the associated error control.
!  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
!  DPRJA    computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = df/dy
!           and the Newton iteration matrix P = I - h*l0*J.
!  DSOLSY   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
!  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
!  DMNORM   computes the weighted max-norm of a vector.
!  DFNORM   computes the norm of a full matrix consistent with the
!           weighted max-norm on vectors.
!  DBNORM   computes the norm of a band matrix consistent with the
!           weighted max-norm on vectors.
!  DSRCAR   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
!           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
!  DGEFA and DGESL   are routines from LINPACK for solving full
!           systems of linear algebraic equations.
!  DGBFA and DGBSL   are routines from LINPACK for solving banded
!           linear systems.
!  DCOPY    is one of the basic linear algebra modules (BLAS).
!  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
!  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
!           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
! Note:  DMNORM, DFNORM, DBNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are
! function routines.  All the others are subroutines.

! This is the 18 November 2003 version of
! DLSODPK: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations,
!          with Preconditioned Krylov iteration methods for the
!          Newton correction linear systems.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODPK solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Introduction.
!
! This is a modification of the DLSODE package which incorporates
! various preconditioned Krylov subspace iteration methods for the
! linear algebraic systems that arise in the case of stiff systems.
!
! The linear systems that must be solved have the form
!   A * x  = b ,  where  A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy) .
! Here hl0 is a scalar, and df/dy is the Jacobian matrix of partial
! derivatives of f (NEQ by NEQ).
!
! The particular Krylov method is chosen by setting the second digit,
! MITER, in the method flag MF.
! Currently, the values of MITER have the following meanings:
!
!  MITER = 1 means the preconditioned Scaled Incomplete
!            Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM).
!
!          2 means an incomplete version of the Preconditioned Scaled
!            Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR).
!            This is the best choice in general.
!
!          3 means the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG).
!            Recommended only when df/dy is symmetric or nearly so.
!
!          4 means the scaled Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method
!            (PCGS).  Recommended only when D-inverse * df/dy * D is
!            symmetric or nearly so, where D is the diagonal scaling
!            matrix with elements 1/EWT(i) (see RTOL/ATOL description).
!
!          9 means that only a user-supplied matrix P (approximating A)
!            will be used, with no Krylov iteration done.  This option
!            allows the user to provide the complete linear system
!            solution algorithm, if desired.
!
! The user can apply preconditioning to the linear system A*x = b,
! by means of arbitrary matrices (the preconditioners).
!     In the case of SPIOM and SPIGMR, one can apply left and right
! preconditioners P1 and P2, and the basic iterative method is then
! applied to the matrix (P1-inverse)*A*(P2-inverse) instead of to the
! matrix A.  The product P1*P2 should be an approximation to matrix A
! such that linear systems with P1 or P2 are easier to solve than with
! A.  Preconditioning from the left only or right only means using
! P2 = identity or P1 = identity, respectively.
!     In the case of the PCG and PCGS methods, there is only one
! preconditioner matrix P (but it can be the product of more than one).
! It should approximate the matrix A but allow for relatively
! easy solution of linear systems with coefficient matrix P.
! For PCG, P should be positive definite symmetric, or nearly so,
! and for PCGS, the scaled preconditioner D-inverse * P * D
! should be symmetric or nearly so.
!     If the Jacobian J = df/dy splits in a natural way into a sum
! J = J1 + J2, then one possible choice of preconditioners is
!     P1 = identity - hl0 * J1  and  P2 = identity - hl0 * J2
! provided each of these is easy to solve (or approximately solve).

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODPK package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the demonstration
! program distributed with this solver.
!
! A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
! which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!
! B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
! Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
! whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
! reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
! use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, MF should be between 21
! and 24, or possibly 29.  MF = 22 is generally the best choice.
! Use 23 or 24 only if symmetry is present.  Use MF = 29 if the
! complete linear system solution is to be provided by the user.
! The following four parameters must also be set.
!  IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for preconditioning.
!  IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for preconditioning.
!  IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
!                  = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
!                  = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
!                  = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
!                  = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
!  IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
!                    = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
!                    = 1 if JAC is to be called.
!  Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant data for use in
!  preconditioning, such as Jacobian elements.
!  The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the user's control,
!  for use in the routines that perform preconditioning operations.
!
! C. If the problem is stiff, you must supply two routines that deal
! with the preconditioning of the linear systems to be solved.
! These are as follows:
!
!     SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V, HL0, WP,IWP, IER)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*),YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*), HL0, WP(*)
!     INTEGER IWP(*)
!        This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
!     Jacobian matrix df/dy involved in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
!     The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and f(t,y),
!     respectively, and YSV also contains the current value of y.
!     The array V is work space of length NEQ.
!     JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian elements by the scalar
!     -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do any factorization
!     operations called for, in preparation for solving linear systems
!     with a coefficient matrix of P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P
!     should be an approximation to  identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
!     JAC should return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
!     (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
!
!     SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK, HL0, WP, IWP, B, LR, IER)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
!     INTEGER IWP(*)
!        This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
!     side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P, as
!     coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
!     LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
!     to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
!     In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
!     should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner matrix P.
!     In the case MF = 29 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
!     and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
!     to A * x = B, where A = identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
!     PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
!     WP and IWP.  WK is a work array of length NEQ.
!     The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
!     in the linear system.  If the old value, at the time of the last
!     JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
!     On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
!       IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
!       IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that the
!              time step will be retried,
!       IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning that the
!              solver is to stop immediately.
!
! D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODPK once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
! DLSODPK.  On the first call to DLSODPK, supply arguments as follows:
! F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             20 + 16*NEQ           for MF = 10,
!             45 + 17*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 21,
!             61 + 17*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 22,
!             20 + 15*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
!             20 + 12*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 29.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least:
!             30            for MF = 10,
!             35 + LIWP     for MF = 21,
!             30 + LIWP     for MF = 22, 23, 24, or 29.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! JAC,PSOL = names of subroutines for preconditioning.
!          These names must be declared External in the calling program.
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method.
!          21 for stiff (BDF) method, with preconditioned SIOM.
!          22 for stiff method, with preconditioned GMRES method.
!          23 for stiff method, with preconditioned CG method.
!          24 for stiff method, with scaled preconditioned CG method.
!          29 for stiff method, with user's PSOL routine only.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2  if DLSODPK was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad JAC
!             or PSOL routine supplied or wrong choice of MF or
!             tolerances, or this solver is inappropriate).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 means an unrecoverable error occurred in PSOL.
!
! F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSODPK again.  No other parameters need be reset.

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODPK.
!
! The user interface to DLSODPK consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODPK, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODPK package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODPK package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!  F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, PSOL, MF,
! and those used for both input and output are
!  Y, T, ISTATE.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODPK to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
!          F must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODPK, an extra call to F should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in the user-supplied subroutines.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODPK package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to F, JAC, and PSOL.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
!          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
!          it to the user-supplied subroutines.  Each such routine must
!          include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F,
!          JAC, and PSOL. Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!          pass it to the user-supplied subroutines.  (The DLSODPK
!          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!          in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          the state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem
!             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means the PSOL routine returned an unrecoverable error
!              flag (IER .lt. 0).  The integration was successful as
!              far as T.
!
!          Note:  since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
!          The length of RWORK must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENLS + LWP    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LENLS = length of work space for linear system (Krylov)
!                  method, excluding preconditioning:
!            LENLS = 0                               if MITER = 0,
!            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3) + MAXL**2          if MITER = 1,
!            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3+MIN(1,MAXL-KMP))
!                 + (MAXL+3)*MAXL + 1                if MITER = 2,
!            LENLS = 6*NEQ                           if MITER = 3 or 4,
!            LENLS = 3*NEQ                           if MITER = 9.
!          (See the MF description for METH and MITER, and the
!          list of optional inputs for MAXL and KMP.)
!          LWP = length of real user work space for preconditioning
!          (see JAC/PSOL).
!          Thus if default values are used and NEQ is constant,
!          this length is:
!             20 + 16*NEQ           for MF = 10,
!             45 + 24*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 11,
!             61 + 24*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 12,
!             20 + 22*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 13 OR 14,
!             20 + 19*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 19,
!             20 + 9*NEQ            FOR MF = 20,
!             45 + 17*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 21,
!             61 + 17*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 22,
!             20 + 15*NEQ + LWP     FOR MF = 23 OR 24,
!             20 + 12*NEQ + LWP     for MF = 29.
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!             30                 if MITER = 0 (MF = 10 or 20),
!             30 + MAXL + LIWP   if MITER = 1 (MF = 11, 21),
!             30 + LIWP          if MITER = 2, 3, 4, or 9.
!          MAXL = 5 unless a different optional input value is given.
!          LIWP = length of integer user work space for preconditioning
!          (see conditional input list following).
!          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 4 words in IWORK are conditional inputs,
!          required if MITER .ge. 1:
!          IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for use in
!                     preconditioning (part of RWORK array).
!          IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for use in
!                     preconditioning (part of IWORK array).
!                     The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the
!                     user's control, for use in the routines that
!                     perform preconditioning operations (JAC and PSOL).
!          IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
!                   = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
!                   = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
!                   = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
!                   = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
!          IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
!                   = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
!                   = 1 if JAC is to be called.
!                     Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant
!                     data needed in preconditioning operations,
!                     such as some of the Jacobian elements.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODPK
! for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODPK between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by any of the user-supplied subroutines).
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute any
!          Jacobian elements (or approximations) involved in the
!          matrix preconditioning operations (MITER .ge. 1).
!          It is to have the form
!            SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V,
!           1                HL0, WP, IWP, IER)
!            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*),YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*),
!           1                 HL0, WP(*)
!            INTEGER IWP(*)
!          This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
!          Jacobian matrix df/dy used in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
!          the Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
!          f(t,y), respectively, and YSV also contains the current
!          value of y.  The array V is work space of length
!          NEQ for use by JAC.  REWT is the array of reciprocal error
!          weights (1/EWT).  JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian
!          elements by the scalar -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do
!          any factorization operations called for, in preparation
!          for solving linear systems with a coefficient matrix of
!          P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P should be an
!          approximation to  identity - HL0 * (df/dy).  JAC should
!          return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
!          (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
!          The arrays WP (of length LWP) and IWP (of length LIWP)
!          are for use by JAC and PSOL for work space and for storage
!          of data needed for the solution of the preconditioner
!          linear systems.  Their lengths and contents are under the
!          user's control.
!          The JAC routine may save relevant Jacobian elements (or
!          approximations) used in the preconditioners, along with the
!          value of HL0, and use these to reconstruct preconditioner
!          matrices later without reevaluationg those elements.
!          This may be cost-effective if JAC is called with HL0
!          considerably different from its earlier value, indicating
!          that a corrector convergence failure has occurred because
!          of the change in HL0, not because of changes in the
!          value of the Jacobian.  In doing this, use the saved and
!          current values of HL0 to decide whether to use saved
!          or reevaluated elements.
!          JAC may alter V, but may not alter Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
!          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! PSOL   = the name of the user-supplied routine for the
!          solution of preconditioner linear systems.
!          It is to have the form
!            SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK,HL0, WP,IWP, B, LR,IER)
!            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
!            INTEGER IWP(*)
!          This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
!          side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P,
!          as coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
!          LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
!          to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
!          In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
!          should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner P.
!          In the case MITER = 9 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
!          and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
!          to A * x = B, where A = identity - HL0 * (df/dy).
!          PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
!          WP and IWP.
!          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
!          f(t,y), respectively.  The array WK is work space of length
!          NEQ for use by PSOL.
!          The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
!          in the linear system.  If the old value, as of the last
!          JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
!          On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
!            IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
!            IER .gt. 0 on a recoverable error, meaning that the
!                   time step will be retried,
!            IER .lt. 0 on an unrecoverable error, meaning that the
!                   solver is to stop immediately.
!          PSOL may not alter Y, FTY, or HL0.
!          PSOL must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine PSOL may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in PSOL) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
!          MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 29.
!          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
!          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
!          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no linear system
!                      is involved).
!            MITER = 1 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
!                      Incomplete Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 2 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
!                      Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 3 means Newton iteration with Preconditioned
!                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCG)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 4 means Newton iteration with scaled Preconditioned
!                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCGS)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 9 means Newton iteration with only the
!                      user-supplied PSOL routine called (no Krylov
!                      iteration) for the linear systems.
!                      JPRE is ignored, and PSOL is called with LR = 0.
!          See comments in the introduction about the choice of MITER.
!          If MITER .ge. 1, the user must supply routines JAC and PSOL
!          (the names are arbitrary) as described above.
!          For MITER = 0, dummy arguments can be used.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! DELT    RWORK(8)  convergence test constant in Krylov iteration
!                   algorithm.  The default is .05.
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!
! MAXL    IWORK(8)  maximum number of iterations in the SPIOM, SPIGMR,
!                   PCG, or PCGS algorithm (.le. NEQ).
!                   The default is MAXL = MIN(5,NEQ).
!
! KMP     IWORK(9)  number of vectors on which orthogonalization
!                   is done in SPIOM or SPIGMR algorithm (.le. MAXL).
!                   The default is KMP = MAXL.
!                   Note:  When KMP .lt. MAXL and MF = 22, the length
!                          of RWORK must be defined accordingly.  See
!                          the definition of RWORK above.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODPK, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODPK
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODPK, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On an illegal input return
! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NPE     IWORK(13) the number of calls to JAC so far (for Jacobian

!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! NNI     IWORK(19) number of nonlinear iterations so far (each of
!                   which calls an iterative linear solver).
!
! NLI     IWORK(20) number of linear iterations so far.
!                   Note: A measure of the success of algorithm is
!                   the average number of linear iterations per
!                   nonlinear iteration, given by NLI/NNI.
!                   If this is close to MAXL, MAXL may be too small.

!                   (PSOL calls) so far.
!
! NCFN    IWORK(22) number of convergence failures of the nonlinear
!                   (Newton) iteration so far.
!                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
!                   rate of nonlinear convergence failures, NCFN/NST.
!
! NCFL    IWORK(23) number of convergence failures of the linear
!                   iteration so far.
!                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
!                   rate of linear convergence failures, NCFL/NNI.
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!                        corrections on each step, scaled on output
!                        to represent the estimated local error in y
!                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
!                        the description of the error control.  It is
!                        defined only on a successful return from
!                        DLSODPK.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODPK.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODPK, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of lun is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODPK.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCPK(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODPK (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 222
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 50 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCPK is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODPK.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (See below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODPK.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODPK).
!             for valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!             by DLSODPK directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODPK is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODPK, and
!   (2) the two internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLPK01/  of length  17  (4 double precision words
!                      followed by 13 integer words).
!
! If DLSODPK is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODPK is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODPK call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODPK call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCPK (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODPK package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODPK call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSODPK in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
! and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where:
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODPK.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

! This is the 18 November 2003 version of
! DLSODKR: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations,
!          with preconditioned Krylov iteration methods for the
!          Newton correction linear systems, and with Rootfinding.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODKR solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
! At the same time, it locates the roots of any of a set of functions
!     g(i) = g(i,t,y(1),...,y(NEQ))  (i = 1,...,ng).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Introduction.
!
! This is a modification of the DLSODE package, and differs from it
! in five ways:
! (a) It uses various preconditioned Krylov subspace iteration methods
! for the linear algebraic systems that arise in the case of stiff
! systems.  See the introductory notes below.
! (b) It does automatic switching between functional (fixpoint)
! iteration and Newton iteration in the corrector iteration.
! (c) It finds the root of at least one of a set of constraint
! functions g(i) of the independent and dependent variables.
! It finds only those roots for which some g(i), as a function
! of t, changes sign in the interval of integration.
! It then returns the solution at the root, if that occurs
! sooner than the specified stop condition, and otherwise returns
! the solution according the specified stop condition.
! (d) It supplies to JAC an input flag, JOK, which indicates whether
! JAC may (optionally) bypass the evaluation of Jacobian matrix data
! and instead process saved data (with the current value of scalar hl0).
! (e) It contains a new subroutine that calculates the initial step
! size to be attempted.
!
!
! Introduction to the Krylov methods in DLSODKR:
!
! The linear systems that must be solved have the form
!   A * x  = b ,  where  A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy) .
! Here hl0 is a scalar, and df/dy is the Jacobian matrix of partial
! derivatives of f (NEQ by NEQ).
!
! The particular Krylov method is chosen by setting the second digit,
! MITER, in the method flag MF.
! Currently, the values of MITER have the following meanings:
!
!  MITER = 1 means the Scaled Preconditioned Incomplete
!            Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM).
!
!          2 means an incomplete version of the preconditioned scaled
!            Generalized Minimal Residual method (SPIGMR).
!            This is the best choice in general.
!
!          3 means the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG).
!            Recommended only when df/dy is symmetric or nearly so.
!
!          4 means the scaled Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method
!            (PCGS).  Recommended only when D-inverse * df/dy * D is
!            symmetric or nearly so, where D is the diagonal scaling
!            matrix with elements 1/EWT(i) (see RTOL/ATOL description).
!
!          9 means that only a user-supplied matrix P (approximating A)
!            will be used, with no Krylov iteration done.  This option
!            allows the user to provide the complete linear system
!            solution algorithm, if desired.
!
! The user can apply preconditioning to the linear system A*x = b,
! by means of arbitrary matrices (the preconditioners).
!     In the case of SPIOM and SPIGMR, one can apply left and right
! preconditioners P1 and P2, and the basic iterative method is then
! applied to the matrix (P1-inverse)*A*(P2-inverse) instead of to the
! matrix A.  The product P1*P2 should be an approximation to matrix A
! such that linear systems with P1 or P2 are easier to solve than with
! A.  Preconditioning from the left only or right only means using
! P2 = identity or P1 = identity, respectively.
!     In the case of the PCG and PCGS methods, there is only one
! preconditioner matrix P (but it can be the product of more than one).
! It should approximate the matrix A but allow for relatively
! easy solution of linear systems with coefficient matrix P.
! For PCG, P should be positive definite symmetric, or nearly so,
! and for PCGS, the scaled preconditioner D-inverse * P * D
! should be symmetric or nearly so.
!     If the Jacobian J = df/dy splits in a natural way into a sum
! J = J1 + J2, then one possible choice of preconditioners is
!     P1 = identity - hl0 * J1  and  P2 = identity - hl0 * J2
! provided each of these is easy to solve (or approximately solve).

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODKR package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the demonstration
! program distributed with this solver.
!
! A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
! which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!
! B. Provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
! which supplies the vector function g by loading GOUT(i) with
! g(i), the i-th constraint function whose root is sought.
!
! C. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
! Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
! whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
! reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
! use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, MF should be between 21
! and 24, or possibly 29.  MF = 22 is generally the best choice.
! Use 23 or 24 only if symmetry is present.  Use MF = 29 if the
! complete linear system solution is to be provided by the user.
! The following four parameters must also be set.
!  IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for preconditioning.
!  IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for preconditioning.
!  IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
!                  = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
!                  = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
!                  = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
!                  = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
!  IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
!                    = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
!                    = 1 if JAC is to be called.
!  Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant data for use in
!  preconditioning, such as Jacobian elements.
!  The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the user's control,
!  for use in the routines that perform preconditioning operations.
!
! D. If the problem is stiff, you must supply two routines that deal
! with the preconditioning of the linear systems to be solved.
! These are as follows:
!
!     SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY,V,HL0,JOK,WP,IWP,IER)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*), HL0,WP(*)
!     INTEGER IWP(*)
!        This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
!     Jacobian matrix df/dy involved in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
!     The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and f(t,y),
!     respectively, and YSV also contains the current value of y.
!     The array V is work space of length NEQ.
!     JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian elements by the scalar
!     -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do any factorization
!     operations called for, in preparation for solving linear systems
!     with a coefficient matrix of P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P
!     should be an approximation to  identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
!     JAC should return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
!     (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
!     JAC may alter Y and V, but not YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
!     The JOK argument can be ignored (or see full description below).
!
!     SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK, HL0, WP, IWP, B, LR, IER)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
!     INTEGER IWP(*)
!        This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
!     side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P, as
!     coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
!     LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
!     to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
!     In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
!     should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner matrix P.
!     In the case MF = 29 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
!     and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
!     to A * x = B, where A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
!     PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
!     WP and IWP.  WK is a work array of length NEQ.
!     The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
!     in the linear system.  If the old value, at the time of the last
!     JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
!     on return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
!       IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
!       IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that the
!              time step will be retried,
!       IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning that the
!              solver is to stop immediately.
!
! E. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODKR once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
! by DLSODKR.  On the first call to DLSODKR, supply arguments as
! follows:
! F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG           for MF = 10,
!             45 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 21,
!             61 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 22,
!             20 + 15*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
!             20 + 12*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 29.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least:
!             30            for MF = 10,
!             35 + LIWP     for MF = 21,
!             30 + LIWP     for MF = 22, 23, 24, or 29.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! JAC,PSOL = names of subroutines for preconditioning.
!          These names must be declared External in the calling program.
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method.
!          21 for stiff (BDF) method, with preconditioned SIOM.
!          22 for stiff method, with preconditioned GMRES method.
!          23 for stiff method, with preconditioned CG method.
!          24 for stiff method, with scaled preconditioned CG method.
!          29 for stiff method, with user's PSOL routine only.
! G      = name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
!          roots are desired during the integration.
!          This name must be declared External in calling program.
! NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
!          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
! JROOT  = integer array of length NG for output of root information.
!          See next paragraph.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
! JROOT, and possibly ATOL.
!
! F. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2 or 3  if DLSODKR was successful, negative otherwise.
!           2 means no root was found, and TOUT was reached as desired.
!           3 means a root was found prior to reaching TOUT.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad JAC
!             or PSOL routine supplied or wrong choice of MF or
!             tolerances, or this solver is inappropriate).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 means an unrecoverable error occurred in PSOL.
! JROOT  = array showing roots found if ISTATE = 3 on return.
!          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at T, or 0 otherwise.
!
! G. To continue the integration after a successful return, proceed
! as follows:
! (a) If ISTATE = 2 on return, reset TOUT and call DLSODKR again.
! (b) If ISTATE = 3 on return, reset ISTATE to 2 and call DLSODKR again.
! In either case, no other parameters need be reset.

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODKR.
!
! The user interface to DLSODKR consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODKR, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODKR package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODKR package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!  F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, PSOL, MF,
!  G, and NG,
! that used only for output is  JROOT,
! and those used for both input and output are
!  Y, T, ISTATE.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODKR to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
!          F must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
!          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODKR, an extra call to F should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in the user-supplied routines.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODKR package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to the user-supplied routines.  Hence, if it is an array,
!          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
!          and pass it to the user-supplied routines. Each such routine
!          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F, G,
!          JAC, and PSOL.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and
!          locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data
!          and pass it to the user-supplied routines.
!          (The DLSODKR package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          If a root was found, T is the computed location of the
!          root reached first, on output.
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!          in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!

!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not

!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          the state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem
!             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!             In addition, immediately following a return with
!             ISTATE = 3 (root found), NG and G may be changed.
!             (But changing NG from 0 to .gt. 0 is not allowed.)
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
!           3  means the integration was successful, and one or more
!              roots were found before satisfying the stop condition
!              specified by ITASK.  See JROOT.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means the PSOL routine returned an unrecoverable error
!              flag (IER .lt. 0).  The integration was successful as
!              far as T.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
!          The length of RWORK must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD+1) + 3*NEQ + 3*NG + LENLS + LWP    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LENLS = length of work space for linear system (Krylov)
!                  method, excluding preconditioning:
!            LENLS = 0                               if MITER = 0,
!            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3) + MAXL**2          if MITER = 1,
!            LENLS = NEQ*(MAXL+3+MIN(1,MAXL-KMP))
!                 + (MAXL+3)*MAXL + 1                if MITER = 2,
!            LENLS = 6*NEQ                           if MITER = 3 or 4,
!            LENLS = 3*NEQ                           if MITER = 9.
!          (See the MF description for METH and MITER, and the
!          list of optional inputs for MAXL and KMP.)
!          LWP = length of real user work space for preconditioning
!          (see JAC/PSOL).
!          Thus if default values are used and NEQ is constant,
!          this length is:
!             20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG           for MF = 10,
!             45 + 24*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 11,
!             61 + 24*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 12,
!             20 + 22*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 13 or 14,
!             20 + 19*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 19,
!             20 + 9*NEQ + 3*NG            for MF = 20,
!             45 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 21,
!             61 + 17*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 22,
!             20 + 15*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 23 or 24,
!             20 + 12*NEQ + 3*NG + LWP     for MF = 29.
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!             30                 if MITER = 0 (MF = 10 or 20),
!             30 + MAXL + LIWP   if MITER = 1 (MF = 11, 21),
!             30 + LIWP          if MITER = 2, 3, 4, or 9.
!          MAXL = 5 unless a different optional input value is given.
!          LIWP = length of integer user work space for preconditioning
!          (see conditional input list following).
!          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 4 words in IWORK are conditional inputs,
!          required if MITER .ge. 1:
!          IWORK(1) = LWP  = length of real array WP for use in
!                     preconditioning (part of RWORK array).
!          IWORK(2) = LIWP = length of integer array IWP for use in
!                     preconditioning (part of IWORK array).
!                     The arrays WP and IWP are work arrays under the
!                     user's control, for use in the routines that
!                     perform preconditioning operations (JAC and PSOL).
!          IWORK(3) = JPRE = preconditioner type flag:
!                   = 0 for no preconditioning (P1 = P2 = P = identity)
!                   = 1 for left-only preconditioning (P2 = identity)
!                   = 2 for right-only preconditioning (P1 = identity)
!                   = 3 for two-sided preconditioning (and PCG or PCGS)
!          IWORK(4) = JACFLG = flag for whether JAC is called.
!                   = 0 if JAC is not to be called,
!                   = 1 if JAC is to be called.
!                     Use JACFLG = 1 if JAC computes any nonconstant
!                     data needed in preconditioning operations,
!                     such as some of the Jacobian elements.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODKR
! for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODKR between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by any of the user-supplied routines).
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute any
!          Jacobian elements (or approximations) involved in the
!          matrix preconditioning operations (MITER .ge. 1).
!          It is to have the form
!            SUBROUTINE JAC (F, NEQ, T, Y, YSV, REWT, FTY, V,
!           1                HL0, JOK, WP, IWP, IER)
!            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YSV(*), REWT(*), FTY(*), V(*),
!           1                 HL0, WP(*)
!            INTEGER IWP(*)
!          This routine must evaluate and preprocess any parts of the
!          Jacobian matrix df/dy used in the preconditioners P1, P2, P.
!          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
!          f(t,y), respectively, and the YSV array also contains
!          the current y vector.  The array V is work space of length
!          NEQ for use by JAC.  REWT is the array of reciprocal error
!          weights (1/EWT).  JAC must multiply all computed Jacobian
!          elements by the scalar -HL0, add the identity matrix, and do
!          any factorization operations called for, in preparation
!          for solving linear systems with a coefficient matrix of
!          P1, P2, or P.  The matrix P1*P2 or P should be an
!          approximation to  identity - hl0 * (df/dy).  JAC should
!          return IER = 0 if successful, and IER .ne. 0 if not.
!          (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller time step will be tried.)
!          The arrays WP (of length LWP) and IWP (of length LIWP)
!          are for use by JAC and PSOL for work space and for storage
!          of data needed for the solution of the preconditioner
!          linear systems.  Their lengths and contents are under the
!          user's control.
!               The argument JOK is an input flag for optional use
!          by JAC in deciding whether to recompute Jacobian elements
!          or use saved values.  If JOK = -1, then JAC must compute
!          any relevant Jacobian elements (or approximations) used in
!          the preconditioners.  Optionally, JAC may also save these
!          elements for later reuse.  If JOK = 1, the integrator has
!          made a judgement (based on the convergence history and the
!          value of HL0) that JAC need not recompute Jacobian elements,
!          but instead use saved values, and the current value of HL0,
!          to reconstruct the preconditioner matrices, followed by
!          any required factorizations.  This may be cost-effective if
!          Jacobian elements are costly and storage is available.
!               JAC may alter Y and V, but not YSV, REWT, FTY, or HL0.
!          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! PSOL   = the name of the user-supplied routine for the
!          solution of preconditioner linear systems.
!          It is to have the form
!            SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, FTY, WK,HL0, WP,IWP, B, LR,IER)
!            DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), FTY(*), WK(*), HL0, WP(*), B(*)
!            INTEGER IWP(*)
!          This routine must solve a linear system with B as right-hand
!          side and one of the preconditioning matrices, P1, P2, or P,
!          as coefficient matrix, and return the solution vector in B.
!          LR is a flag concerning left vs right preconditioning, input
!          to PSOL.  PSOL is to use P1 if LR = 1 and P2 if LR = 2.
!          In the case of the PCG or PCGS method, LR will be 3, and PSOL
!          should solve the system P*x = B with the preconditioner P.
!          In the case MITER = 9 (no Krylov iteration), LR will be 0,
!          and PSOL is to return in B the desired approximate solution
!          to A * x = B, where A = identity - hl0 * (df/dy).
!          PSOL can use data generated in the JAC routine and stored in
!          WP and IWP.
!          The Y and FTY arrays contain the current values of y and
!          f(t,y), respectively.  The array WK is work space of length
!          NEQ for use by PSOL.
!          The argument HL0 is the current value of the scalar appearing
!          in the linear system.  If the old value, as of the last
!          JAC call, is needed, it must have been saved by JAC in WP.
!          On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows:
!	     IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
!            IER .gt. 0 on a recoverable error, meaning that the
!                   time step will be retried,
!            IER .lt. 0 on an unrecoverable error, meaning that the
!                   solver is to stop immediately.
!          PSOL may not alter Y, FTY, or HL0.
!          PSOL must be declared External in the calling program.
!               Subroutine PSOL may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in PSOL) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
!          MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 29.
!          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
!          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
!          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!            MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no linear system
!                      is involved).
!            MITER = 1 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
!                      Incomplete Orthogonalization Method (SPIOM)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 2 means Newton iteration with Scaled Preconditioned
!                      Incomplete Generalized Minimal Residual method
!                      (SPIGMR) for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 3 means Newton iteration with Preconditioned
!                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCG)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 4 means Newton iteration with scaled preconditioned
!                      Conjugate Gradient method (PCGS)
!                      for the linear systems.
!            MITER = 9 means Newton iteration with only the
!                      user-supplied PSOL routine called (no Krylov
!                      iteration) for the linear systems.
!                      JPRE is ignored, and PSOL is called with LR = 0.
!          See comments in the introduction about the choice of MITER.
!          If MITER .ge. 1, the user must supply routines JAC and PSOL
!          (the names are arbitrary) as described above.
!          For MITER = 0, a dummy argument can be used.
!
! G      = the name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose
!          roots are desired during the integration.  It is to have
!          the form
!               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, and NG are input, and the array GOUT
!          is output.  NEQ, T, and Y have the same meaning as in
!          the F routine, and GOUT is an array of length NG.
!          For i = 1,...,NG, this routine is to load into GOUT(i)
!          the value at (t,y) of the i-th constraint function g(i).
!          DLSODKR will find roots of the g(i) of odd multiplicity
!          (i.e. sign changes) as they occur during the integration.
!          G must be declared External in the calling program.
!
!          Caution: Because of numerical errors in the functions
!          g(i) due to roundoff and integration error, DLSODKR may
!          return false roots, or return the same root at two or more
!          nearly equal values of t.  If such false roots are
!          suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances
!          and/or higher precision in the evaluation of the g(i).
!
!          If a root of some g(i) defines the end of the problem,
!          the input to DLSODKR should nevertheless allow integration
!          to a point slightly past that root, so that DLSODKR can
!          locate the root by interpolation.
!
!          Subroutine G may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in G) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!
! NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none,
!          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G.
!
! JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Used only for output.
!          On a return with ISTATE = 3 (one or more roots found),
!          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at t, or JROOT(i) = 0 if not.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! DELT    RWORK(8)  convergence test constant in Krylov iteration
!                   algorithm.  The default is .05.
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!
! MAXL    IWORK(8)  maximum number of iterations in the SPIOM, SPIGMR,
!                   PCG, or PCGS algorithm (.le. NEQ).
!                   The default is MAXL = MIN(5,NEQ).
!
! KMP     IWORK(9)  number of vectors on which orthogonalization
!                   is done in SPIOM or SPIGMR algorithm (.le. MAXL).
!                   The default is KMP = MAXL.
!                   Note:  When KMP .lt. MAXL and MF = 22, the length
!                          of RWORK must be defined accordingly.  See
!                          the definition of RWORK above.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODKR, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODKR
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODKR, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On an illegal input return
! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NGE     IWORK(10) the number of g evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
!
! NPE     IWORK(13) the number of calls to JAC so far (for evaluation
!                   of preconditioners).
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! NNI     IWORK(19) number of nonlinear iterations so far (each of
!                   which calls an iterative linear solver).
!
! NLI     IWORK(20) number of linear iterations so far.
!                   Note: A measure of the success of algorithm is
!                   the average number of linear iterations per
!                   nonlinear iteration, given by NLI/NNI.
!                   If this is close to MAXL, MAXL may be too small.
!
! NPS     IWORK(21) number of preconditioning solve operations
!                   (PSOL calls) so far.
!
! NCFN    IWORK(22) number of convergence failures of the nonlinear
!                   (Newton) iteration so far.
!                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
!                   rate of nonlinear convergence failures, NCFN/NST.
!
! NCFL    IWORK(23) number of convergence failures of the linear
!                   iteration so far.
!                   Note: A measure of success is the overall
!                   rate of linear convergence failures, NCFL/NNI.
!
! NSFI    IWORK(24) number of functional iteration steps so far.
!                   Note: A measure of the extent to which the

!
! NJEV    IWORK(25) number of JAC calls with JOK = -1 so far
!                   (number of evaluations of Jacobian data).
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21 + 3*NG      the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!                        corrections on each step, scaled on output
!                        to represent the estimated local error in y
!                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
!                        the description of the error control.  It is
!                        defined only on a successful return from
!                        DLSODKR.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODKR.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODKR, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODKR.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCKR(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODKR (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 228
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 63 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCKR is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODKR.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODKR.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   LYH = 21 + 3*NG
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODKR).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!             by DLSODKR directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! LYH       = 21 + 3*NG = base address in RWORK of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODKR is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODKR, and
!   (2) the four internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLS002/  of length   5  (1 double precision word
!                      followed by  4 integer words),
!         /DLPK01/  of length  17  (4 double precision words
!                      followed by 13 integer words),
!         /DLSR01/  of length  14     (5 double precision words
!                      followed by  9 integer words).
!
! If DLSODKR is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODKR is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODKR call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODKR call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCKR (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODKR package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODKR call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSODKR in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
! and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where:
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODKR.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

! Other routines in the DLSODKR package.
!
! In addition to Subroutine DLSODKR, the DLSODKR package includes the
! following subroutines and function routines:
!  DLHIN    calculates a step size to be attempted initially.
!  DRCHEK   does preliminary checking for roots, and serves as an
!           interface between Subroutine DLSODKR and Subroutine DROOTS.
!  DROOTS   finds the leftmost root of a set of functions.
!  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
!  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
!  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
!  DSTOKA   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
!           integration and the associated error control.
!  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
!  DSETPK   interfaces between DSTOKA and the JAC routine.
!  DSOLPK   manages solution of linear system in Newton iteration.
!  DSPIOM   performs the SPIOM algorithm.
!  DATV     computes a scaled, preconditioned product (I-hl0*J)*v.
!  DORTHOG  orthogonalizes a vector against previous basis vectors.
!  DHEFA    generates an LU factorization of a Hessenberg matrix.
!  DHESL    solves a Hessenberg square linear system.
!  DSPIGMR  performs the SPIGMR algorithm.
!  DHEQR    generates a QR factorization of a Hessenberg matrix.
!  DHELS    finds the least squares solution of a Hessenberg system.
!  DPCG     performs preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm (PCG).
!  DPCGS    performs the PCGS algorithm.
!  DATP     computes the product A*p, where A = I - hl0*df/dy.
!  DUSOL    interfaces to the user's PSOL routine (MITER = 9).
!  DSRCKR   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
!           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
!  DAXPY, DCOPY, DDOT, DNRM2, and DSCAL   are basic linear
!           algebra modules (from the BLAS collection).
!  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
!  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
!           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
! Note:  DVNORM, DDOT, DNRM2, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function
! routines.  All the others are subroutines.

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODI package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
! which computes the residual function
!     r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
! as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
! generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
! to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
! vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
! ignored for casual use of DLSODI.  (For uses of IRES, see the
! paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
!
! B. Next, decide whether full or banded form is more economical
! for the storage of matrices.  DLSODI must deal internally with the
! matrices A and dr/dy, where r is the residual function defined above.
! DLSODI generates a linear combination of these two matrices, and
! this is treated in either full or banded form.
!     The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag MF,
! which is 21 or 22 for the full case, and 24 or 25 in the band case.
!     In the banded case, DLSODI requires two half-bandwidth
! parameters ML and MU.  These are, respectively, the widths of the
! lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.
! Thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
! i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU, and the full bandwidth is ML+MU+1.
! Note that the band must accommodate the nonzero elements of
! A(t,y), dg/dy, and d(A*s)/dy (s fixed).  Alternatively, one
! can define a band that encloses only the elements that are relatively
! large in magnitude, and gain some economy in storage and possibly
! also efficiency, although the appropriate threshhold for
! retaining matrix elements is highly problem-dependent.
!
! C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(NROWP,*)
! which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
! T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
!     In the full matrix case, this routine should add elements of
! to P in the usual order.  I.e., add A(i,j) to P(i,j).  (Ignore the
! ML and MU arguments in this case.)
!     In the band matrix case, this routine should add element A(i,j)
! to P(i-j+MU+1,j).  I.e., add the diagonal lines of A to the rows of
! P from the top down (the top line of A added to the first row of P).
!
! D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
! Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
! (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
! use MF = 21 or 24, and provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), P(NROWP,*)
! which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
! S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into P as follows:
!     In the full matrix case (MF = 21), load P(i,j) with dr(i)/dy(j),
! the partial derivative of r(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore the
! ML and MU arguments in this case.)
!     In the band matrix case (MF = 24), load P(i-j+mu+1,j) with
! dr(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of dr/dy into the rows of
! P from the top down.
!     In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the
! indexing of P is the same as in the ADDA routine.
!     Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
! is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
!     If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
! MF = 22 or 25, and DLSODI will compute an approximate Jacobian
! internally by difference quotients.
!
! E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
! derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
! nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODI compute
! this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODI will solve the system A*s = g for
! s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
! singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
! you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
! initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
! load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
! The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
! the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
! r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
!
! F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODI once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
! by DLSODI.  On the first call to DLSODI, supply arguments as follows:
! RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
! ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
! JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
!          (MF = 21 or 24).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
! Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
!        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
! NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
!          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
!             22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 20 + NEQ.
!          If MF = 24 or 25, input in IWORK(1),IWORK(2) the lower
!          and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          21 for a user-supplied full Jacobian.
!          22 for an internally generated full Jacobian.
!          24 for a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
!          25 for an internally generated banded Jacobian.
!          for other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
!          the full description below.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! G. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2  if DLSODI was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
!          -8 means DLSODI was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
!             In casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
!             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
!
!  If DLSODI returns ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, then the output of
!  DLSODI also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
!  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
!
! H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSODI again.  No other parameters need be reset.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example Problem.
!
! The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
! needed for its solution by DLSODI.  The problem is from chemical
! kinetics, and consists of the following three equations:
!     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
!     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
!       0.   = y1 + y2 + y3 - 1.
! on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
! y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.
!
! The following coding solves this problem with DLSODI, using MF = 21
! and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
! ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
! y2 has much smaller values.  dy/dt is supplied in YDOTI. We had
! obtained the initial value of dy3/dt by differentiating the
! third equation and evaluating the first two at t = 0.
! At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
! printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODI.
!
! The user interface to DLSODI consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODI, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODI package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODI package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
!     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODI to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
!          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
!            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
!          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
!          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
!          is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
!          IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
!             On input, IRES indicates how DLSODI will use the
!          returned array R, as follows:
!             IRES = 1  means that DLSODI needs the full residual,
!                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
!             IRES = -1 means that DLSODI is using R only to compute
!                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
!          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
!          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
!          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
!          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
!          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
!             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
!          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
!          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
!             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
!          DLSODI continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
!          unchanged from its input value.
!             IRES = 2 tells DLSODI to immediately return control
!          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
!          the calling program change parameters of the problem,
!          if necessary.
!             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
!          illegal value of y).  DLSODI tries to integrate the system
!          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODI
!          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
!             On an DLSODI return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
!          of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
!          successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
!             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
!          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
!          done by calling DLSODI in a one-step mode and checking the
!          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
!             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODI, an extra call to RES should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
!             RES must be declared External in the calling
!          program.  See note below for more about RES.
!
! ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
!          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix stored in the same form
!          as A.  The storage form is determined by MITER (see MF).
!          This subroutine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(NROWP,*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWP are input and P is
!          output.  Y is an array of length NEQ, and the matrix P is
!          stored in an NROWP by NEQ array.
!             In the full matrix case ( MITER = 1 or 2) ADDA should
!          add  A    to P(i,j).  ML and MU are ignored.
!                i,j
!             In the band matrix case ( MITER = 4 or 5) ADDA should
!          add  A    to  P(i-j+MU+1,j).
!                i,j
!          See JAC for details on this band storage form.
!             ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
!          See note below for more information about ADDA.
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies the
!          Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  The form of the
!          Jacobian matrix is determined by MITER.  JAC is required
!          if MITER = 1 or 4 -- otherwise a dummy name can be
!          passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC ( NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, P, NROWP )
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), P(NROWP,*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, and NROWP are input and P
!          is output.  Y and S are arrays of length NEQ, and the
!          matrix P is stored in an NROWP by NEQ array.
!          P is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements
!          of the Jacobian matrix) on output.
!             In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU
!          are ignored and the Jacobian is to be loaded into P
!          by columns-- i.e., dr(i)/dy(j) is loaded into P(i,j).
!             In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements
!          within the band are to be loaded into P by columns,
!          with diagonal lines of dr/dy loaded into the
!          rows of P.  Thus dr(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded
!          into P(i-j+MU+1,j).  The locations in P in the two
!          triangular areas which correspond to nonexistent matrix
!          elements can be ignored or loaded arbitrarily, as they
!          they are overwritten by DLSODI.  ML and MU are the
!          half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
!               In either case, P is preset to zero by the solver,
!          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to RES with the same
!          arguments NEQ, T, Y, and S.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!          saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed by JAC
!          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
!               JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
!          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
!               JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               See note below for more about JAC.
!
!    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
!          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
!          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these routines should not alter
!          NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
!          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
!          Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODI package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
!          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
!          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
!          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
!          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
!          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
!          vector, evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
!          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
!          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
!          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSODI
!          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
!
! YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
!          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
!
!          On input:
!            If ISTATE = 0, then DLSODI will compute the initial value
!          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
!          serve only as work space and may have any value.
!            If ISTATE = 1, then YDOTI must contain the initial value
!          of dy/dt.
!            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls), then YDOTI
!          may have any value.
!            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
!          DLSODI cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
!          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
!
!          On output, when DLSODI terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
!          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
!          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
!          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
!          then there may have been an incorrect input value of
!          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSODI)
!          may not have a solution.
!
!          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
!          purposes between calls to the solver.
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
!          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
!          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
!          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             DLSODI is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
!             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
!             YDOTI (DLSODI will do other initializations).  See note
!             below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, ML, MU,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and
!              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
!           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
!              DLSODI to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
!              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
!              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
!              next step.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              the integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
!              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
!              DLSODI to avoid that condition.
!          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSODI was unable
!              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
!              printed message for details.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
!          DLSODI to return because the calling program must change
!          the parameters of the problem.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
!          The length of RWORK must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENWM    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LENWM   = NEQ**2 + 2    if MITER is 1 or 2, and
!          LENWM   = (2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ + 2 if MITER is 4 or 5.
!          (See MF description for the definition of METH and MITER.)
!          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
!          this length is
!             22 + 16*NEQ + NEQ**2         for MF = 11 or 12,
!             22 + 17*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ  for MF = 14 or 15,
!             22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2         for MF = 21 or 22,
!             22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!          20 + NEQ .  The first few words of IWORK are used for
!          conditional and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
!            IWORK(1) = ML     These are the lower and upper
!            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
!                       matrices in the problem-- the Jacobian dr/dy
!                       and the left-hand side matrix A. These
!                       half-bandwidths exclude the main diagonal,
!                       so the total bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
!                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
!                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
!                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
!                       These are required if MITER is 4 or 5, and
!                       ignored otherwise.
!                       ML and MU may in fact be the band parameters
!                       for matrices to which dr/dy and A are only
!                       approximately equal.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODI
! for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODI between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
!
! MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
!          MF are 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, and 25.
!          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
!            METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!              METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!              METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                       Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
!                The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff
!              problems, while the Adams method is preferred when
!              the problem is not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is
!              nonsingular, stiffness here can be taken to mean that of
!              the explicit ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is
!              singular, the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
!                If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
!              recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
!              of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
!              not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
!              If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
!              with METH may be necessary.
!            MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!              MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
!                        full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
!              MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
!                        generated (difference quotient) full Jacobian.
!                        This uses NEQ+1 extra calls to RES per dr/dy
!                        evaluation.
!              MITER = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
!                        banded Jacobian.
!              MITER = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
!                        generated banded Jacobian (using ML+MU+2
!                        extra calls to RES per dr/dy evaluation).
!              If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
!              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!              For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! the use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODI, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODI
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODI, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
! input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
!                   for the problem so far.
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
!                   an evaluation of A and dr/dy) for the problem so
!                   far.  This equals the number of calls to ADDA and
!                   (if MITER = 1 or 4) JAC, and the number of matrix
!                   LU decompositions.
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
!                        represent the estimated local error in y on the
!                        last step. This is the vector E in the descrip-
!                        tion of the error control.  It is defined only
!                        on a return from DLSODI with ISTATE = 2.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODI.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODI, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODI.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODI (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 218
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 37 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCOM is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODI.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODI.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODI).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!             by DLSODI directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODI is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODI, and
!   (2) the internal Common block
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!
! If DLSODI is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common block in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODI is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODI call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODI call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODI package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODI call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSODI in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
! and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where:
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODI.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

! This is the 18 November 2003 version of

!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSOIBT solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
! or, in component form,
!     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =
!        i,1      1                     i,NEQ      NEQ

!           i      1   2       NEQ
!
! If A is singular, this is a differential-algebraic system.
!

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSOIBT package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
! which computes the residual function
!     r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
! as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
! generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
! to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
! vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
! ignored for casual use of DLSOIBT.  (For uses of IRES, see the
! paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
!
! B. Next, identify the block structure of the matrices A = A(t,y) and
! dr/dy.  DLSOIBT must deal internally with a linear combination, P, of
! these two matrices.  The matrix P (hence both A and dr/dy) must have
! a block-tridiagonal form with fixed structure parameters
!     MB = block size, MB .ge. 1, and
!     NB = number of blocks in each direction, NB .ge. 4,
! with MB*NB = NEQ.  In each of the NB block-rows of the matrix P
! (each consisting of MB consecutive rows), the nonzero elements are
! to lie in three consecutive MB by MB blocks.  In block-rows
! 2 through NB - 1, these are centered about the main diagonal.
! in block-rows 1 and NB, they are the diagonal blocks and the two
! blocks adjacent to the diagonal block.  (Thus block positions (1,3)
! and (NB,NB-2) can be nonzero.)
! Alternatively, P (hence A and dr/dy) may be only approximately
! equal to matrices with this form, and DLSOIBT should still succeed.
! The block-tridiagonal matrix P is described by three arrays,
! each of size MB by MB by NB:
!     PA = array of diagonal blocks,
!     PB = array of superdiagonal (and one subdiagonal) blocks, and
!     PC = array of subdiagonal (and one superdiagonal) blocks.
! Specifically, the three MB by MB blocks in the k-th block-row of P
! are stored in (reading across):
!     PC(*,*,k) = block to the left of the diagonal block,
!     PA(*,*,k) = diagonal block, and
!     PB(*,*,k) = block to the right of the diagonal block,
! except for k = 1, where the three blocks (reading across) are
!     PA(*,*,1) (= diagonal block), PB(*,*,1), and PC(*,*,1),
! and k = NB, where they are
!     PB(*,*,NB), PC(*,*,NB), and PA(*,*,NB) (= diagonal block).
! (Each asterisk * stands for an index that ranges from 1 to MB.)
!
! C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
!     SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB), PC(MB,MB,NB)
! which adds the nonzero blocks of the matrix A = A(t,y) to the
! contents of the arrays PA, PB, and PC, following the structure
! description in Paragraph B above.
! T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
! Thus the affect of ADDA should be the following:
!     DO 30 K = 1,NB
!       DO 20 J = 1,MB
!         DO 10 I = 1,MB
!           PA(I,J,K) = PA(I,J,K) +
!             ( (I,J) element of K-th diagonal block of A)
!           PB(I,J,K) = PB(I,J,K) +
!             ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K+1) of A,
!             or in block position (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
!           PC(I,J,K) = PC(I,J,K) +
!             ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K-1) of A,
!             or in block position (1,3) if K = 1)
! 10        CONTINUE
! 20      CONTINUE
! 30    CONTINUE
!
! D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
! Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
! (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
! use MF = 21, and provide a subroutine of the form:
!     SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB),
!    1                 PC(MB,MB,NB)
! which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
! S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into PA, PB, PC,
! according to the structure description in Paragraph B above.
! That is, load the diagonal blocks into PA, the superdiagonal blocks
! (and block (NB,NB-2) ) into PB, and the subdiagonal blocks (and
! block (1,3) ) into PC.  The blocks in block-row k of dr/dy are to
! be loaded into PA(*,*,k), PB(*,*,k), and PC(*,*,k).
!     Only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the indexing
! of PA, PB, and PC is the same as in the ADDA routine.
!     Note that if A is independent of Y (or this dependence
! is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
!     If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
! MF = 22, and DLSOIBT will compute an approximate Jacobian
! internally by difference quotients.
!
! E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
! derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
! nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSOIBT compute
! this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSOIBT will solve the system A*s = g for
! s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
! singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
! you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
! initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
! load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
! The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
! the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
! r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
!
! F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSOIBT once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
! DLSOIBT.  on the first call to DLSOIBT, supply arguments as follows:
! RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
! ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
! JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
!          (MF = 21).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
! Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
!        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
! NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
!          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             22 + 9*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB        for MF = 21 or 22.
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 20 + NEQ.
!          Input in IWORK(1) the block size MB and in IWORK(2) the
!          number NB of blocks in each direction along the matrix A.
!          These must satisfy  MB .ge. 1, NB .ge. 4, and MB*NB = NEQ.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          21 for a user-supplied Jacobian.
!          22 for an internally generated Jacobian.
!          For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
!          the full description below.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! G. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE = 2  if DLSOIBT was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
!          -8 means DLSOIBT was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
!             In casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
!             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
!
!  If DLSOIBT returns ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, then the output of
!  DLSOIBT also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
!  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
!
! H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSOIBT again.  No other parameters need be reset.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example Problem.
!
! The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
! for its solution by DLSOIBT.  The problem comes from the partial
! differential equation (the Burgers equation)
!   du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
! on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are
!   du/dx = 0  at x = -1 and at x = 1.
! The initial profile is a square wave,
!   u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
! The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
! using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
! The equations at x = -1 and 1 use a 3-point difference approximation
! for the right-hand side.  The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y),
! of size NEQ = 41, where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i),
! with x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/(NEQ-1) = .05.  The individual
! equations in the system are
!   dy(1)/dt = ( y(3) - 2*y(2) + y(1) ) * eta / delx**2,
!   dy(NEQ)/dt = ( y(NEQ-2) - 2*y(NEQ-1) + y(NEQ) ) * eta / delx**2,
! and for i = 2, 3, ..., NEQ-1,
!   (1/6) dy(i-1)/dt + (4/6) dy(i)/dt + (1/6) dy(i+1)/dt
!       = ( y(i-1)**2 - y(i+1)**2 ) / (4*delx)
!         + ( y(i+1) - 2*y(i) + y(i-1) ) * eta / delx**2.
! The following coding solves the problem with MF = 21, with output
! of solution statistics at t = .1, .2, .3, and .4, and of the
! solution vector at t = .4.  Here the block size is just MB = 1.

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSOIBT.
!
! The user interface to DLSOIBT consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSOIBT, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSOIBT package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSOIBT package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
!     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for additional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSOIBT to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
!          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
!            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
!          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
!          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
!          is to have the form
!              SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!              DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
!          IRES are output. Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
!             On input, IRES indicates how DLSOIBT will use the
!          returned array R, as follows:
!             IRES = 1  means that DLSOIBT needs the full residual,
!                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
!             IRES = -1 means that DLSOIBT is using R only to compute
!                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
!          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
!          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
!          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
!          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
!          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
!             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
!          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
!          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
!             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
!          DLSOIBT continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
!          unchanged from its input value.
!             IRES = 2 tells DLSOIBT to immediately return control
!          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
!          the calling program change parameters of the problem
!          if necessary.
!             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
!          illegal value of y).  DLSOIBT tries to integrate the system
!          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSOIBT
!          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
!             On an DLSOIBT return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the
!          values of T and Y returned correspond to the last point
!          reached successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
!             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
!          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
!          done by calling DLSOIBT in a one-step mode and checking the
!          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
!             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
!          externally to DLSOIBT, an extra call to RES should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
!             RES must be declared External in the calling
!          program. See note below for more about RES.

! ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
!          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix, P, stored in
!          block-tridiagonal form.  This routine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB),

! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
!          the Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  JAC is
!          required if MITER = 1.  Otherwise a dummy name can be
!          passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PA(MB,MB,NB),
!              1                 PB(MB,MB,NB), PC(MB,MB,NB)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC
!          are input, and the arrays PA, PB, and PC are output.
!          Y and S are arrays of length NEQ, and the arrays PA, PB, PC
!          are all MB by MB by NB.
!          PA, PB, and PC are to be loaded with partial derivatives
!          (elements of the Jacobian matrix) on output, in terms of the
!          block-tridiagonal structure assumed, as described
!          in Paragraph B of the Summary of Usage above.
!          That is, load the diagonal blocks into PA, the
!          superdiagonal blocks (and block (NB,NB-2) ) into PB, and
!          the subdiagonal blocks (and block (1,3) ) into PC.
!          The blocks in block-row k of dr/dy are to be loaded into
!          PA(*,*,k), PB(*,*,k), and PC(*,*,k).
!          Thus the affect of JAC should be the following:
!               DO 30 K = 1,NB
!                 DO 20 J = 1,MB
!                   DO 10 I = 1,MB
!                     PA(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of
!                       K-th diagonal block of dr/dy)
!                     PB(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of block (K,K+1)
!                       of dr/dy, or block (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
!                     PC(I,J,K) = ( (I,J) element of block (K,K-1)
!                       of dr/dy, or block (1,3) if K = 1)
!           10        CONTINUE
!           20      CONTINUE
!           30    CONTINUE
!               PA, PB, and PC are preset to zero by the solver,
!          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to RES with the same
!          arguments NEQ, T, Y, and S.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!          saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed by JAC
!          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
!               JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
!          approximation will do, so that DLSOIBT may be used when
!          A and dr/dy are not really block-tridiagonal, but are close
!          to matrices that are.
!               JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!               See note below for more about JAC.
!
!    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
!          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
!          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these routines should not alter
!          NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
!          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
!          Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSOIBT package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
!          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
!          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
!          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
!          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
!          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
!          vector, evaluated at t.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
!          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
!          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
!          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSOIBT
!          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
!
! YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
!          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
!
!          On input:
!            If ISTATE = 0 then DLSOIBT will compute the initial value
!          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
!          serve only as work space and may have any value.
!            If ISTATE = 1 then YDOTI must contain the initial value
!          of dy/dt.
!            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then YDOTI
!          may have any value.
!            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
!          DLSOIBT cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
!          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
!
!          On output, when DLSOIBT terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
!          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
!          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
!          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
!          there may have been an incorrect input value of
!          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSOIBT)
!          may not have a solution.
!
!          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
!          purposes between calls to the solver.
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
!          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
!          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
!          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             DLSOIBT is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
!             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
!             YDOTI (DLSOIBT will do other initializations).
!             See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, MB, NB,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!             (See IWORK description for MB and NB.)
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and
!              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
!           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
!              DLSOIBT to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
!              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
!              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
!              next step.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i) = 0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
!              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
!              DLSOIBT to avoid that condition.
!          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSOIBT was unable
!              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
!              printed message for details.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          Similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
!          DLSOIBT to return because the calling program must change
!          the parameters of the problem.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a real working array (double precision).
!          The length of RWORK must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LENWM    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LENWM  = 3*MB*MB*NB + 2.
!          (See MF description for the definition of METH.)
!          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
!          this length is
!             22 + 16*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB     for MF = 11 or 12,
!             22 + 9*NEQ + 3*MB*MB*NB      for MF = 21 or 22.
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!          20 + NEQ .  The first few words of IWORK are used for
!          additional and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following 2 words in IWORK are additional required
!          inputs to DLSOIBT:
!            IWORK(1) = MB = block size
!            IWORK(2) = NB = number of blocks in the main diagonal
!          These must satisfy  MB .ge. 1, NB .ge. 4, and MB*NB = NEQ.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSOIBT
! for the same problem, except possibly for the additional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSOIBT between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
!
! MF     = the method flag.  used only for input.  The legal values of
!          MF are 11, 12, 21, and 22.
!          MF has decimal digits METH and MITER: MF = 10*METH + MITER.
!            METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!              METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!              METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                       Differentiation Formulas (BDFS).
!                The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff
!              problems, while the Adams method is preferred when the
!              problem is not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is
!              nonsingular, stiffness here can be taken to mean that of
!              the explicit ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is
!              singular, the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
!                If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
!              recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
!              of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
!              not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
!              If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
!              with METH may be necessary.
!            MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!              MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
!                        block-tridiagonal Jacobian.
!              MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
!                        generated (difference quotient) block-
!                        tridiagonal Jacobian approximation, using
!                        3*MB+1 extra calls to RES per dr/dy evaluation.
!              If MITER = 1, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
!              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!              For MITER = 2, a dummy argument can be used.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSOIBT, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSOIBT
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSOIBT, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
! input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
!                   for the problem so far.
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
!                   an evaluation of a and dr/dy) for the problem so
!                   far.  This equals the number of calls to ADDA and
!                   (if MITER = 1) to JAC, and the number of matrix
!                   LU decompositions.
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
!
! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.
!
! ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
!                        represent the estimated local error in y on
!                        the last step.  This is the vector E in the
!                        description of the error control.  It is
!                        defined only on a return from DLSOIBT with
!                        ISTATE = 2.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSOIBT.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSOIBT, if
!                             the default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSOIBT.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCOM(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSOIBT (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 218
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 37 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCOM is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSOIBT.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSOIBT.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the t last returned by DLSOIBT).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
!             by DLSOIBT directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSOIBT is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSOIBT, and
!   (2) the internal Common block
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!
! If DLSOIBT is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common block in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSOIBT is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSOIBT call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSOIBT call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSOIBT package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSOIBT call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSOIBT in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
! and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where:
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSOIBT.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

! This is the 18 November 2003 version of
! DLSODIS: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations
!          (Implicit form) with general Sparse Jacobian matrices.
!
! This version is in double precision.
!
! DLSODIS solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
! systems of first order ODEs,
!     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
! or, in component form,
!     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =
!        i,1      1                     i,NEQ      NEQ
!
!      =   g ( t, y , y ,..., y    )   ( i = 1,...,NEQ )
!           i      1   2       NEQ
!
! If A is singular, this is a differential-algebraic system.
!
! DLSODIS is a variant version of the DLSODI package, and is intended
! for stiff problems in which the matrix A and the Jacobian matrix
! d(g - A*s)/dy have arbitrary sparse structures.

! Summary of Usage.
!
! Communication between the user and the DLSODIS package, for normal
! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
! details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
! and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!
! A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
!                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
! which computes the residual function
!      r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
! as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
! generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
! to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
! vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
! ignored for casual use of DLSODIS.  (For uses of IRES, see the
! paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
!
! B. DLSODIS must deal internally with the matrices A and dr/dy, where
! r is the residual function defined above.  DLSODIS generates a linear
! combination of these two matrices in sparse form.
!      The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag, MF:
!         MF =  21 or  22     when the user provides the structures of
!                             matrix A and dr/dy,
!         MF = 121 or 222     when the user does not provide structure
!                             information, and
!         MF = 321 or 422     when the user provides the structure
!                             of matrix A.
!
! C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
!                SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
!                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
!                INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
! which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
! NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments and should not be altered.
! This routine should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array
! P (of length NEQ).  I.e. add A(i,J) to P(i) for all relevant
! values of i.  The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal
! situations.  DLSODIS will call the ADDA routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
!
! D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
! Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
! (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
! use MF = 21, 121, or 321, and provide a subroutine of the form:
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
!               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
! which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here NEQ, T, Y, S,
! and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to load the array
! PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of dr/dy.  I.e. load PDJ(i)
! with dr(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.  The arguments IAN and
! JAN should be ignored for normal situations.  DLSODIS will call the
! JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
!      Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  A crude approximation
! to dr/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elememts, will suffice.
! Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
! is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
!      If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
! MF = 22, 222, or 422 and DLSODIS will compute an approximate
! Jacobian internally by difference quotients.
!
! E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
! derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
! nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODIS compute
! this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODIS will solve the system A*s = g for
! s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
! singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
! you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
! initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
! load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
! The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
! the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
! r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI   must be approximately zero.
!
! F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODIS once for
! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
! DLSODIS.  On the first call to DLSODIS, supply arguments as follows:
! RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
! ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
! JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
!          (MF = 121).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
! Note: The names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
!        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
! NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
! Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
! YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
! T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
! TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
! ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
! RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
! ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
!          The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
!          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
! ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
! ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
!          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
! IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
! RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
!             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
!          where:
!          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
!                   iteration matrix  P = A - con*dr/dy (con = scalar)
!                   (If NNZ is unknown, use an estimate of it.)
!          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
!                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
!          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
!          be predicted in advance for any value of MF, and the
!          value above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.
!          Some experimentation with this size may be necessary.
!          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
!          output, available in IWORK(17).)
! LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
! IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
! LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
! MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
!          121 for a user-supplied sparse Jacobian.
!          222 for an internally generated sparse Jacobian.
!          For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
!          the full description below.
! Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
! and possibly ATOL.
!
! G. The output from the first call, or any call, is:
!      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
! ISTATE =  2  if DLSODIS was successful, negative otherwise.
!          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
!          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
!          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
!          -8 means DLSODIS was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
!             in casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
!             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
!          -9 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
!             CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
!
!          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, may result from using
!          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
!          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
!          DLSODIS again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
!          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
!
!  If DLSODIS returns ISTATE = -1, -4  or -5, then the output of
!  DLSODIS also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
!  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
!
! H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
! reset TOUT and call DLSODIS again.  No other parameters need be reset.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example Problem.
!
! The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
! for its solution by DLSODIS.  The problem comes from the partial
! differential equation (the Burgers equation)
!   du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
! on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are periodic:
!   u(-1,t) = u(1,t)  and  du/dx(-1,t) = du/dx(1,t)
! The initial profile is a square wave,
!   u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
! The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
! using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
! The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y), of size NEQ = 40,
! where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i), with
! x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/NEQ = .05.
! The individual equations in the system are (in order):
!  (1/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(4/6)dy(1)/dt+(1/6)dy(2)/dt
!       = r4d*(y(NEQ)**2-y(2)**2)+eodsq*(y(2)-2*y(1)+y(NEQ))
! for i = 2,3,...,nm1,
!  (1/6)dy(i-1)/dt+(4/6)dy(i)/dt+(1/6)dy(i+1)/dt
!       = r4d*(y(i-1)**2-y(i+1)**2)+eodsq*(y(i+1)-2*y(i)+y(i-1))
! and finally
!  (1/6)dy(nm1)/dt+(4/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(1/6)dy(1)/dt
!       = r4d*(y(nm1)**2-y(1)**2)+eodsq*(y(1)-2*y(NEQ)+y(nm1))
! where r4d = 1/(4*delx), eodsq = eta/delx**2 and nm1 = NEQ-1.
! The following coding solves the problem with MF = 121, with output
! of solution statistics at t = .1, .2, .3, and .4, and of the
! solution vector at t = .4.  Optional outputs (run statistics) are
! also printed.

! Full Description of User Interface to DLSODIS.
!
! The user interface to DLSODIS consists of the following parts.
!
! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODIS, which is a driver
!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!      Following these descriptions is a description of
!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!
! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODIS package that may be
!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!
! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!
! 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODIS package, either of
!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!      These relate to the measurement of errors.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!
! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
!     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
! and those used for both input and output are
!     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
! to the return from Subroutine DLSODIS to the user's calling program.)
!
! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!
! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
!
! RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
!          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
!            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
!          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
!          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
!          is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
!          IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
!             On input, IRES indicates how DLSODIS will use the
!          returned array R, as follows:
!             IRES = 1  means that DLSODIS needs the full residual,
!                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
!             IRES = -1 means that DLSODIS is using R only to compute
!                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
!          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
!          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
!          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
!          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
!          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
!             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
!          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
!          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
!             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
!          DLSODIS continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
!          unchanged from its input value.
!             IRES = 2 tells DLSODIS to immediately return control
!          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
!          the calling program change parameters of the problem
!          if necessary.
!             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
!          illegal value of y).  DLSODIS tries to integrate the system
!          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODIS
!          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
!             On a return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
!          of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
!          successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
!             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
!          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
!          done by calling DLSODIS in a one-step mode and checking the
!          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
!             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
!          externally to DLSODIS, an extra call to RES should be made
!          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
!             RES must be declared External in the calling
!          program.  See note below for more about RES.
!
! ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
!          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix stored in sparse form.
!          This subroutine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
!               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
!          where NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, and P  are input.  This routine
!          should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array P, of
!          length NEQ.  Thus a(i,J) is to be added to P(i) for all
!          relevant values of i.  Here T and Y have the same meaning as
!          in Subroutine RES, and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).
!          IAN and JAN are undefined in calls to ADDA for structure
!          determination (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are
!          structure descriptors, as defined under optional outputs
!          below, and so can be used to determine the relevant row
!          indices i, if desired.
!               Calls to ADDA are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that
!          order.  ADDA must not alter its input arguments.
!               ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
!          See note below for more information about ADDA.
!
! JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
!          the Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  JAC is
!          required if MITER = 1, or MOSS = 1 or 3.  Otherwise a dummy
!          name can be passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
!               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
!               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
!         where NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, and JAN are input.  The
!         array PDJ, of length NEQ, is to be loaded with column J
!         of the Jacobian on output.  Thus dr(i)/dy(J) is to be
!         loaded into PDJ(i) for all relevant values of i.
!         Here T, Y, and S have the same meaning as in Subroutine RES,
!         and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).  IAN and JAN
!         are undefined in calls to JAC for structure determination
!         (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are structure
!         descriptors, as defined under optional outputs below, and
!         so can be used to determine the relevant row indices i, if
!         desired.
!              JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
!         approximation (possibly with greater sparsity) will do.
!              In any case, PDJ is preset to zero by the solver,
!         so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!         Calls to JAC are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that order, and
!         each such set of calls is preceded by a call to RES with the
!         same arguments NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES.  Thus to gain some
!         efficiency intermediate quantities shared by both calculations
!         may be saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed
!         by JAC, if desired.  JAC must not alter its input arguments.
!              JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!              See note below for more about JAC.
!
!    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
!          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
!          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
!          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these subroutines should not
!          alter NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
!          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!
! NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
!          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
!          Used only for input.
!          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.
!
!          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
!          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!          (The DLSODIS package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
!          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
!          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
!          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!
! Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
!          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
!          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
!          vector, evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!
!          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
!          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
!          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
!          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSODIS
!          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )
!
! YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
!          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.
!
!          On input:
!            If ISTATE = 0 then DLSODIS will compute the initial value
!          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
!          serve only as work space and may have any value.
!            If ISTATE = 1 then YDOTI must contain the initial value
!          of dy/dt.
!            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then YDOTI
!          may have any value.
!            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
!          DLSODIS cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
!          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.
!
!          On output, when DLSODIS terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
!          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
!          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
!          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
!          there may have been an incorrect input value of
!          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSODIS)
!          may not have a solution.
!
!          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
!          purposes between calls to the solver.
!
! T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!
! TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!          Used only for input.
!
!          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
!          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
!          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
!          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
!          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!
!          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!
!          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!          TCUR and HU).
!
! ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!
! RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!          Input only.
!
! ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
!          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!
!             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!          in y, according to an inequality of the form
!                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
!          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
!          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
!          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
!          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
!          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!
!             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
!              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!
!          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
!          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
!
!          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!          error controls can be obtained by substituting
!          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
!          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
!
!          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!          down uniformly.
!
! ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
!          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!          2  means take one step only and return.
!          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!             beyond t = TOUT and return.
!          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!
!          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!
! ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
!          state of the calculation.
!
!          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
!          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             DLSODIS is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
!             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
!          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
!             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
!             YDOTI (DLSODIS will do other initializations).
!             See note below.
!          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!             tested for legality.)
!          3  means this is not the first call, and the
!             calculation is to continue normally, but with
!             a change in input parameters other than
!             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
!             the conditional inputs IA, JA, IC, and JC,
!             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
!             A call with ISTATE = 3 will cause the sparsity
!             structure of the problem to be recomputed.
!             (Structure information is reread from IA and JA if
!             MOSS = 0, 3, or 4 and from IC and JC if MOSS = 0).
!          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!
!          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and
!              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
!           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
!           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
!              DLSODIS to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
!              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
!              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
!              next step.
!          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!              completing the requested task, but the integration
!              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!              integration steps.  See written message for details.
!              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!              the run to stop.
!          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!              may be inappropriate.
!          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!              one attempted step, before completing the requested
!              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
!          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i) = 0.0)
!              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!              the integration was successful as far as T.
!          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
!              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
!              DLSODIS to avoid that condition.
!          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSODIS was unable
!              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
!              printed message for details.
!          -9  means a fatal error return flag came from the sparse
!              solver CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS (numerical
!              factorization or backsolve).  This should never happen.
!              The integration was successful as far as T.
!
!          Note: An error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5
!          may mean that the sparsity structure of the
!          problem has changed significantly since it was last
!          determined (or input).  In that case, one can attempt to
!          complete the integration by setting ISTATE = 3 on the next
!          call, so that a new structure determination is done.
!
!          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!          similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
!          DLSODIS to return because the calling program must change
!          the parameters of the problem.
!          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!          calling the solver again.
!
! IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!                   Default values will be used in all cases.
!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!
! RWORK  = a work array used for a mixture of real (double precision)
!          and integer work space.
!          The length of RWORK (in real words) must be at least
!             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
!          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
!                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
!          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+9*NEQ)/LENRAT   if MITER = 1,
!          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+10*NEQ)/LENRAT  if MITER = 2.
!          in the above formulas,
!          NNZ    = number of nonzero elements in the iteration matrix
!                   P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and J is the
!                   Jacobian matrix dr/dy).
!          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
!                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
!          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
!          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
!          the minimum length of RWORK is:
!             20 + 16*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 11, 111, 311, 12, 212, 412,
!             20 +  9*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 21, 121, 321, 22, 222, 422.
!          The above formula for LWM is only a crude lower bound.
!          The required length of RWORK cannot be readily predicted
!          in general, as it depends on the sparsity structure
!          of the problem.  Some experimentation may be necessary.
!
!          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
!          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
!            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
!                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
!                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)
!
! LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
!            32 + 2*NEQ + NZA + NZC   for MOSS = 0,
!            30                       for MOSS = 1 or 2,
!            31 + NEQ + NZA           for MOSS = 3 or 4.
!          (NZA is the number of nonzero elements in matrix A, and
!          NZC is the number of nonzero elements in dr/dy.)
!
!          In DLSODIS, IWORK is used for conditional and
!          optional inputs and optional outputs.
!
!          The following two blocks of words in IWORK are conditional
!          inputs, required if MOSS = 0, 3, or 4, but not otherwise
!          (see the description of MF for MOSS).
!            IWORK(30+j) = IA(j)     (j=1,...,NEQ+1)
!            IWORK(31+NEQ+k) = JA(k) (k=1,...,NZA)
!          The two arrays IA and JA describe the sparsity structure
!          to be assumed for the matrix A.  JA contains the row
!          indices where nonzero elements occur, reading in columnwise
!          order, and IA contains the starting locations in JA of the
!          descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in that order, with
!          IA(1) = 1.  Thus, for each column index j = 1,...,NEQ, the
!          values of the row index i in column j where a nonzero
!          element may occur are given by
!            i = JA(k),  where   IA(j) .le. k .lt. IA(j+1).
!          If NZA is the total number of nonzero locations assumed,
!          then the length of the JA array is NZA, and IA(NEQ+1) must
!          be NZA + 1.  Duplicate entries are not allowed.
!          The following additional blocks of words are required
!          if MOSS = 0, but not otherwise.  If LC = 31 + NEQ + NZA, then
!            IWORK(LC+j) = IC(j)       (j=1,...,NEQ+1), and
!            IWORK(LC+NEQ+1+k) = JC(k) (k=1,...,NZC)
!          The two arrays IC and JC describe the sparsity
!          structure to be assumed for the Jacobian matrix dr/dy.
!          They are used in the same manner as the above IA and JA
!          arrays.  If NZC is the number of nonzero locations
!          assumed, then the length of the JC array is NZC, and
!          IC(NEQ+1) must be NZC + 1.  Duplicate entries are not
!          allowed.
!
! LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!          (This will be checked by the solver.)
!
! Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODIS
! for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
! optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
! available for use by the user outside DLSODIS between calls, if
! desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).
!
! MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.
!          MF has three decimal digits-- MOSS, METH, and MITER.
!          For standard options:
!             MF = 100*MOSS + 10*METH + MITER.
!          MOSS indicates the method to be used to obtain the sparsity
!          structure of the Jacobian matrix:
!            MOSS = 0 means the user has supplied IA, JA, IC, and JC
!                     (see descriptions under IWORK above).
!            MOSS = 1 means the user has supplied JAC (see below) and
!                     the structure will be obtained from NEQ initial
!                     calls to JAC and NEQ initial calls to ADDA.
!            MOSS = 2 means the structure will be obtained from NEQ+1
!                     initial calls to RES and NEQ initial calls to ADDA
!            MOSS = 3 like MOSS = 1, except user has supplied IA and JA.
!            MOSS = 4 like MOSS = 2, except user has supplied IA and JA.
!          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
!            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
!            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
!                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
!              The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff problems,
!            while the Adams method is preferred when the problem is
!            not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is nonsingular,
!            stiffness here can be taken to mean that of the explicit
!            ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is singular,
!            the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
!              If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
!            recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
!            of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
!            not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
!            If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
!            with METH may be necessary.
!          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
!            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
!                      sparse Jacobian, given by Subroutine JAC.
!            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
!                      generated (difference quotient) sparse
!                      Jacobian (using NGP extra calls to RES per
!                      dr/dy value, where NGP is an optional
!                      output described below.)
!            If MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1 or 3 the user must supply a
!            Subroutine JAC (the name is arbitrary) as described above
!            under JAC.  Otherwise, a dummy argument can be used.
!
!          The standard choices for MF are:
!            MF = 21 or 22 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and IC/JC
!                 supplied,
!            MF = 121 for a stiff problem with JAC supplied, but not
!                 IA/JA or IC/JC,
!            MF = 222 for a stiff problem with neither IA/JA, IC/JC/,
!                 nor JAC supplied,
!            MF = 321 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and JAC supplied,
!                 but not IC/JC,
!            MF = 422 for a stiff problem with IA/JA supplied, but not
!                 IC/JC or JAC.
!
!          The sparseness structure can be changed during the problem
!          by making a call to DLSODIS with ISTATE = 3.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Inputs.
!
! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
!
! H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!                   The default value is determined by the solver.
!
! HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is infinite.
!
! HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!
! MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
!                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
!                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
!                   be reduced to the default value.
!                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
!                   cause the current order to be reduced.
!
! MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!                   allowed during one call to the solver.
!                   The default value is 500.
!
! MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
!                   value.  The default value is 10.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Optional Outputs.
!
! As optional additional output from DLSODIS, the variables listed
! below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODIS
! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
! Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
! on any successful return from DLSODIS, and on any return with
! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
! input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
! as noted below.
!
! Name    Location      Meaning
!
! HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
!
! HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!
! TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
!                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!                   will always be at least as far as the argument
!                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!
! TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!
! NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!
! NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
!                   for the problem so far, excluding those for
!                   structure determination (MOSS = 2 or 4).
!
! NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
!                   an evaluation of A and dr/dy) for the problem so
!                   far, excluding those for structure determination
!                   (MOSS = 1 or 3).  This equals the number of calls
!                   to ADDA and (if MITER = 1) JAC.
!
! NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
!
! NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
!
! IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!
! LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
!                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!                   input return for insufficient storage.
!
! NNZ     IWORK(19) the number of nonzero elements in the iteration
!                   matrix  P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and
!                   J is the Jacobian matrix dr/dy).
!
! NGP     IWORK(20) the number of groups of column indices, used in
!                   difference quotient Jacobian aproximations if
!                   MITER = 2.  This is also the number of extra RES
!                   evaluations needed for each Jacobian evaluation.
!
! NLU     IWORK(21) the number of sparse LU decompositions for the
!                   problem so far. (Excludes the LU decomposition
!                   necessary when ISTATE = 0.)
!
! LYH     IWORK(22) the base address in RWORK of the history array YH,
!                   described below in this list.
!
! IPIAN   IWORK(23) the base address of the structure descriptor array
!                   IAN, described below in this list.
!
! IPJAN   IWORK(24) the base address of the structure descriptor array
!                   JAN, described below in this list.
!
! NZL     IWORK(25) the number of nonzero elements in the strict lower
!                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
!                   iteration.
!
! NZU     IWORK(26) the number of nonzero elements in the strict upper
!                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
!                   iteration.  The total number of nonzeros in the
!                   factorization is therefore NZL + NZU + NEQ.
!
! The following four arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
! its base address, and its description.
! For YH and ACOR, the base addresses are in RWORK (a real array).
! The integer arrays IAN and JAN are to be obtained by declaring an
! integer array IWK and identifying IWK(1) with RWORK(21), using either
! an equivalence statement or a subroutine call.  Then the base
! addresses IPIAN (of IAN) and IPJAN (of JAN) in IWK are to be obtained
! as optional outputs IWORK(23) and IWORK(24), respectively.
! Thus IAN(1) is IWK(ipian), etc.
!
! Name    Base Address      Description
!
! IAN    IPIAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NEQ + 1.
! JAN    IPJAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NNZ.
!         (see above)    IAN and JAN together describe the sparsity
!                        structure of the iteration matrix
!                          P = A - con*J,  as used by DLSODIS.
!                        JAN contains the row indices of the nonzero
!                        locations, reading in columnwise order, and
!                        IAN contains the starting locations in JAN of
!                        the descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in
!                        that order, with IAN(1) = 1.  Thus for each
!                        j = 1,...,NEQ, the row indices i of the
!                        nonzero locations in column j are
!                        i = JAN(k),  IAN(j) .le. k .lt. IAN(j+1).
!                        Note that IAN(NEQ+1) = NNZ + 1.
! YH      LYH            the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!          (optional     (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value

!                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
!                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
!                        evaluated at t = TCUR.  The base address LYH
!                        is another optional output, listed above.
!
! ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated

!                        description of the error control. It is defined
!                        only on a return from DLSODIS with ISTATE = 2.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!
! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODIS.
! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
! SLATEC error handling package.)
!
!     Form of Call                  Function
!   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!                             output of messages from DLSODIS, if
!                             The default is not desired.
!                             The default value of LUN is 6.
!
!   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
!                             messages by DLSODIS.
!                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
!                             This risks losing valuable information.)
!                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
!
!                             Either of the above calls may be made at
!                             any time and will take effect immediately.
!
!   CALL DSRCMS(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
!                             the internal Common blocks used by
!                             DLSODIS (see Part 3 below).
!                             RSAV must be a real array of length 224
!                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
!                             array of length 71 or more.
!                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
!                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
!                                DSRCMS is useful if one is
!                             interrupting a run and restarting
!                             later, or alternating between two or
!                             more problems solved with DLSODIS.
!
!   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
!        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
!                             desired.  It may be called only after
!                             a successful return from DLSODIS.
!
! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
! The form of the call is:
!
!   LYH = IWORK(22)
!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!
! The input parameters are:
!
! T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
!             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODIS).
!             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
! K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
!             by DLSODIS directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
! LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
!             as an optional output as shown above.
! NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!
! The output parameters are:
!
! DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
! IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!             On an error return, a message is also written.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 3.  Common Blocks.
!
! If DLSODIS is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
! must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
!   (1) the call sequence to DLSODIS, and
!   (2) the two internal Common blocks
!         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
!                      followed by 37 integer words),
!         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
!                      followed by 34 integer words).
!
! If DLSODIS is used on a system in which the contents of internal
! Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
! declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
! that their contents are preserved.
!
! If the solution of a given problem by DLSODIS is to be interrupted
! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
! following the return from the last DLSODIS call prior to the
! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
! internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
! next DLSODIS call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
! blocks, use Subroutines DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!
! Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODIS package which
! relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!
! (a) DEWSET.
! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODIS call sequence,
! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
! routine (see below), and also used by DLSODIS in the computation
! of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
! quotient Jacobians.
!
! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
! are available from the history array YH, described above under
! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
! factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!     NQ = ILS(33)
!     NST = ILS(34)
!     H = RLS(212)
! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!
! (b) DVNORM.
! The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
! root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
!     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
! where:
!   N = the length of the vector,
!   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
!   W = real array of length N containing weights,
!   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
! DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
! EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
!
! If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
! value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODIS.
! None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
! For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
!   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*w(I)) for the RMS-norm, or
!   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
!    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Other routines in the DLSODIS package.
!
! In addition to Subroutine DLSODIS, the DLSODIS package includes the
! following subroutines and function routines:
!  DIPREPI  acts as an interface between DLSODIS and DPREPI, and also
!           does adjusting of work space pointers and work arrays.
!  DPREPI   is called by DIPREPI to compute sparsity and do sparse
!           matrix preprocessing.
!  DAINVGS  computes the initial value of the vector
!             dy/dt = A-inverse * g
!  ADJLR    adjusts the length of required sparse matrix work space.
!           It is called by DPREPI.
!  CNTNZU   is called by DPREPI and counts the nonzero elements in the
!           strict upper triangle of P + P-transpose.
!  JGROUP   is called by DPREPI to compute groups of Jacobian column
!           indices for use when MITER = 2.
!  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
!  DSTODI   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
!           integration and the associated error control.
!  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
!  DPRJIS   computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = dr/dy
!           and the Newton iteration matrix P = A - h*l0*J.
!  DSOLSS   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
!  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
!  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
!  DSRCMS   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
!           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
!  ODRV     constructs a reordering of the rows and columns of
!           a matrix by the minimum degree algorithm.  ODRV is a
!           driver routine which calls Subroutines MD, MDI, MDM,
!           MDP, MDU, and SRO.  See Ref. 2 for details.  (The ODRV
!           module has been modified since Ref. 2, however.)
!  CDRV     performs reordering, symbolic factorization, numerical
!           factorization, or linear system solution operations,
!           depending on a path argument IPATH.  CDRV is a
!           driver routine which calls Subroutines NROC, NSFC,
!           NNFC, NNSC, and NNTC.  See Ref. 3 for details.
!           DLSODIS uses CDRV to solve linear systems in which the
!           coefficient matrix is  P = A - con*J, where A is the
!           matrix for the linear system A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y),
!           con is a scalar, and J is an approximation to
!           the Jacobian dr/dy.  Because CDRV deals with rowwise
!           sparsity descriptions, CDRV works with P-transpose, not P.
!           DLSODIS also uses CDRV to solve the linear system
!             A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y)  for dy/dt when ISTATE = 0.
!           (For this, CDRV works with A-transpose, not A.)
!  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
!  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
!           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
! Note:  DVNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function routines.
! All the others are subroutines.

! arrays.  Pointers to RWORK/IWORK segments are named by prefixing L to

! Segments of RWORK (in order) are denoted  WM, YH, SAVR, EWT, ACOR.
! The required length of the matrix work space WM is not yet known,

! as possible, to leave the maximum amount of space for WM for matrix
! preprocessing.  Thus if MOSS .ne. 2 or 4, some of the segments of
! RWORK are temporarily omitted, as they are not needed in the

      SUBROUTINE DCFODE (METH, ELCO, TESCO)
!***BEGIN PROLOGUE  DCFODE
!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Set ODE integrator coefficients.
!***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SCFODE-S, DCFODE-D)
!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  DCFODE is called by the integrator routine to set coefficients
!  needed there.  The coefficients for the current method, as
!  given by the value of METH, are set for all orders and saved.
!  The maximum order assumed here is 12 if METH = 1 and 5 if METH = 2.
!  (A smaller value of the maximum order is also allowed.)
!  DCFODE is called once at the beginning of the problem,
!  and is not called again unless and until METH is changed.
!
!  The ELCO array contains the basic method coefficients.
!  The coefficients el(i), 1 .le. i .le. nq+1, for the method of
!  order nq are stored in ELCO(i,nq).  They are given by a genetrating
!  polynomial, i.e.,
!      l(x) = el(1) + el(2)*x + ... + el(nq+1)*x**nq.
!  For the implicit Adams methods, l(x) is given by
!      dl/dx = (x+1)*(x+2)*...*(x+nq-1)/factorial(nq-1),    l(-1) = 0.
!  For the BDF methods, l(x) is given by
!      l(x) = (x+1)*(x+2)* ... *(x+nq)/K,
!  where         K = factorial(nq)*(1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/nq).
!
!  The TESCO array contains test constants used for the
!  local error test and the selection of step size and/or order.
!  At order nq, TESCO(k,nq) is used for the selection of step
!  size at order nq - 1 if k = 1, at order nq if k = 2, and at order
!  nq + 1 if k = 3.

!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Interpolate solution derivatives.
!***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SINTDY-S, DINTDY-D)
!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  DINTDY computes interpolated values of the K-th derivative of the
!  dependent variable vector y, and stores it in DKY.  This routine
!  is called within the package with K = 0 and T = TOUT, but may
!  also be called by the user for any K up to the current order.
!  (See detailed instructions in the usage documentation.)
!
!  The computed values in DKY are gotten by interpolation using the
!  Nordsieck history array YH.  This array corresponds uniquely to a
!  vector-valued polynomial of degree NQCUR or less, and DKY is set
!  to the K-th derivative of this polynomial at T.
!  The formula for DKY is:
!               q
!   DKY(i)  =  sum  c(j,K) * (T - tn)**(j-K) * h**(-j) * YH(i,j+1)
!              j=K
!  where  c(j,K) = j*(j-1)*...*(j-K+1), q = NQCUR, tn = TCUR, h = HCUR.
!  The quantities  nq = NQCUR, l = nq+1, N = NEQ, tn, and h are
!  communicated by COMMON.  The above sum is done in reverse order.
!  IFLAG is returned negative if either K or T is out of bounds.

!***SUBSIDIARY
!***PURPOSE  Compute and process Newton iteration matrix.
!***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SPREPJ-S, DPREPJ-D)
!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  DPREPJ is called by DSTODE to compute and process the matrix
!  P = I - h*el(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
!  Here J is computed by the user-supplied routine JAC if
!  MITER = 1 or 4, or by finite differencing if MITER = 2, 3, or 5.
!  If MITER = 3, a diagonal approximation to J is used.
!  J is stored in WM and replaced by P.  If MITER .ne. 3, P is then
!  subjected to LU decomposition in preparation for later solution
!  of linear systems with P as coefficient matrix.  This is done
!  by DGEFA if MITER = 1 or 2, and by DGBFA if MITER = 4 or 5.
!
!  In addition to variables described in DSTODE and DLSODE prologues,
!  communication with DPREPJ uses the following:
!  Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
!  FTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODE).
!  SAVF  = array containing f evaluated at predicted y.
!  WM    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
!          inverse diagonal matrix if MITER = 3 and the LU decomposition
!          of P if MITER is 1, 2 , 4, or 5.
!          Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
!          WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
!          WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
!          WM(2) = H*EL0, saved for later use if MITER = 3.
!  IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
!          IWM(21), if MITER is 1, 2, 4, or 5.  IWM also contains band
!          parameters ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
!  EL0   = EL(1) (input).
!  IERPJ = output error flag,  = 0 if no trouble, .gt. 0 if
!          P matrix found to be singular.
!  JCUR  = output flag = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian matrix
!          (or approximation) is now current.
!  This routine also uses the COMMON variables EL0, H, TN, UROUND,
!  MITER, N, NFE, and NJE.

!***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SSOLSY-S, DSOLSY-D)
!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  This routine manages the solution of the linear system arising from
!  a chord iteration.  It is called if MITER .ne. 0.
!  If MITER is 1 or 2, it calls DGESL to accomplish this.
!  If MITER = 3 it updates the coefficient h*EL0 in the diagonal
!  matrix, and then computes the solution.
!  If MITER is 4 or 5, it calls DGBSL.
!  Communication with DSOLSY uses the following variables:
!  WM    = real work space containing the inverse diagonal matrix if
!          MITER = 3 and the LU decomposition of the matrix otherwise.
!          Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
!          WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
!          WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND) (not used here),
!          WM(2) = HL0, the previous value of h*EL0, used if MITER = 3.
!  IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
!          IWM(21), if MITER is 1, 2, 4, or 5.  IWM also contains band
!          parameters ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.
!  X     = the right-hand side vector on input, and the solution vector
!          on output, of length N.
!  TEM   = vector of work space of length N, not used in this version.
!  IERSL = output flag (in COMMON).  IERSL = 0 if no trouble occurred.
!          IERSL = 1 if a singular matrix arose with MITER = 3.
!  This routine also uses the COMMON variables EL0, H, MITER, and N.

!***PURPOSE  Performs one step of an ODEPACK integration.
!***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (SSTODE-S, DSTODE-D)
!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  DSTODE performs one step of the integration of an initial value
!  problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
!  Note:  DSTODE is independent of the value of the iteration method
!  indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
!  of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
!  Communication with DSTODE is done with the following variables:
!
!  NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!           passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
!  Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
!           all calls to F and JAC.
!  YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
!           and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
!           LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
!           j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by h**j/factorial(j)
!           (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  on entry for the first step, the first
!           two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
!  NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
!  YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
!  EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
!           for local error measurements.  Local errors in Y(i) are
!           compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
!  SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
!           Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
!           and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
!  ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
!           corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
!           the estimated one-step local error in Y(i).
!  WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
!           operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
!  PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
!           and P = I - h*el0*JAC, if a chord method is being used.
!  SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
!  CCMAX  = maximum relative change in h*el0 before PJAC is called.
!  H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!           H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
!           problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
!           sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
!  HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size h to be used.
!  HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of h to be used.
!           HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite hmax.
!           HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
!           take effect until the next change of h is considered.
!  TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
!  JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
!           values and meanings:
!                0  perform the first step.
!            .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
!               -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
!                     N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
!               -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                     but with other inputs unchanged.
!           On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
!  KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
!                0  the step was succesful.
!               -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
!               -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
!               -3  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
!           A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
!           abs(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
!           On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
!           the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
!           step, and H is the last step size attempted.
!  MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
!  MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
!  MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls (MITER .gt. 0).
!  MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
!  METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
!  N      = the number of first-order differential equations.
!  The values of CCMAX, H, HMIN, HMXI, TN, JSTART, KFLAG, MAXORD,
!  MAXCOR, MSBP, MXNCF, METH, MITER, and N are communicated via COMMON.

! This routine performs preprocessing related to the sparse linear
! systems that must be solved if MITER = 1 or 2.
! The operations that are performed here are:
!  * compute sparseness structure of Jacobian according to MOSS,
!  * compute grouping of column indices (MITER = 2),
!  * compute a new ordering of rows and columns of the matrix,
!  * reorder JA corresponding to the new ordering,
!  * perform a symbolic LU factorization of the matrix, and
!  * set pointers for segments of the IWK/WK array.
! In addition to variables described previously, DPREP uses the
! following for communication:
! YH     = the history array.  Only the first column, containing the
!          current Y vector, is used.  Used only if MOSS .ne. 0.
! SAVF   = a work array of length NEQ, used only if MOSS .ne. 0.
! EWT    = array of length NEQ containing (inverted) error weights.
!          Used only if MOSS = 2 or if ISTATE = MOSS = 1.
! FTEM   = a work array of length NEQ, identical to ACOR in the driver,
!          used only if MOSS = 2.
! WK     = a real work array of length LENWK, identical to WM in
!          the driver.
! IWK    = integer work array, assumed to occupy the same space as WK.
! LENWK  = the length of the work arrays WK and IWK.
! ISTATC = a copy of the driver input argument ISTATE (= 1 on the
!          first call, = 3 on a continuation call).
! IYS    = flag value from ODRV or CDRV.
! IPPER  = output error flag with the following values and meanings:
!          0  no error.
!         -1  insufficient storage for internal structure pointers.
!         -2  insufficient storage for JGROUP.
!         -3  insufficient storage for ODRV.
!         -4  other error flag from ODRV (should never occur).

! DPRJS is called to compute and process the matrix
! P = I - H*EL(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
! J is computed by columns, either by the user-supplied routine JAC
! if MITER = 1, or by finite differencing if MITER = 2.
! if MITER = 3, a diagonal approximation to J is used.
! if MITER = 1 or 2, and if the existing value of the Jacobian
! (as contained in P) is considered acceptable, then a new value of
! P is reconstructed from the old value.  In any case, when MITER
! is 1 or 2, the P matrix is subjected to LU decomposition in CDRV.
! P and its LU decomposition are stored (separately) in WK.
!
! In addition to variables described previously, communication
! with DPRJS uses the following:
! Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
! FTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODE).
! SAVF  = array containing f evaluated at predicted y.
! WK    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
!         inverse diagonal matrix if MITER = 3, and P and its sparse
!         LU decomposition if MITER is 1 or 2.
!         Storage of matrix elements starts at WK(3).
!         WK also contains the following matrix-related data:
!         WK(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
!         WK(2) = H*EL0, saved for later use if MITER = 3.
! IWK   = integer work space for matrix-related data, assumed to
!         be equivalenced to WK.  In addition, WK(IPRSP) and IWK(IPISP)
!         are assumed to have identical locations.
! EL0   = EL(1) (input).
! IERPJ = output error flag (in Common).
!       = 0 if no error.
!       = 1  if zero pivot found in CDRV.
!       = 2  if a singular matrix arose with MITER = 3.
!       = -1 if insufficient storage for CDRV (should not occur here).
!       = -2 if other error found in CDRV (should not occur here).
! JCUR  = output flag showing status of (approximate) Jacobian matrix:

!***********************************************************************
!
!  description
!
!    odrv finds a minimum degree ordering of the rows and columns
!    of a matrix m stored in (ia,ja,a) format (see below).  for the
!    reordered matrix, the work and storage required to perform
!    gaussian elimination is (usually) significantly less.
!
!    note.. odrv and its subordinate routines have been modified to
!    compute orderings for general matrices, not necessarily having any
!    symmetry.  the miminum degree ordering is computed for the
!    structure of the symmetric matrix  m + m-transpose.
!    modifications to the original odrv module have been made in
!    the coding in subroutine mdi, and in the initial comments in
!    subroutines odrv and md.
!
!    if only the nonzero entries in the upper triangle of m are being
!    stored, then odrv symmetrically reorders (ia,ja,a), (optionally)
!    with the diagonal entries placed first in each row.  this is to
!    ensure that if m(i,j) will be in the upper triangle of m with
!    respect to the new ordering, then m(i,j) is stored in row i (and
!    thus m(j,i) is not stored),  whereas if m(i,j) will be in the
!    strict lower triangle of m, then m(j,i) is stored in row j (and
!    thus m(i,j) is not stored).
!
!
!  storage of sparse matrices
!
!    the nonzero entries of the matrix m are stored row-by-row in the
!    array a.  to identify the individual nonzero entries in each row,
!    we need to know in which column each entry lies.  these column
!    indices are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
!    ja(k) = j.  to identify the individual rows, we need to know where
!    each row starts.  these row pointers are stored in the array ia.
!    i.e., if m(i,j) is the first nonzero entry (stored) in the i-th row
!    and  a(k) = m(i,j),  then  ia(i) = k.  moreover, ia(n+1) points to
!    the first location following the last element in the last row.
!    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is  ia(i+1) - ia(i),
!    the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored consecutively in
!
!            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
!
!    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
!
!            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).
!
!    when the coefficient matrix is symmetric, only the nonzero entries
!    in the upper triangle need be stored.  for example, the matrix
!
!             ( 1  0  2  3  0 )
!             ( 0  4  0  0  0 )
!         m = ( 2  0  5  6  0 )
!             ( 3  0  6  7  8 )
!             ( 0  0  0  8  9 )
!
!    could be stored as
!
!            - 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
!         ---+--------------------------------------
!         ia - 1  4  5  8 12 14

!          a - 1  2  3  4  2  5  6  3  6  7  8  8  9

!  description
!
!    md finds a minimum degree ordering of the rows and columns of a
!    general sparse matrix m stored in (ia,ja,a) format.
!    when the structure of m is nonsymmetric, the ordering is that
!    obtained for the symmetric matrix  m + m-transpose.
!
!
!  additional parameters
!
!    max  - declared dimension of the one-dimensional arrays v and l.
!           max must be at least  n+2k,  where k is the number of
!           nonzeroes in the strict upper triangle of m + m-transpose
!
!    v    - integer one-dimensional work array.  dimension = max
!
!    l    - integer one-dimensional work array.  dimension = max
!
!    head - integer one-dimensional work array.  dimension = n
!
!    last - integer one-dimensional array used to return the permutation
!           of the rows and columns of m corresponding to the minimum
!           degree ordering.  dimension = n
!
!    next - integer one-dimensional array used to return the inverse of
!           the permutation returned in last.  dimension = n
!
!    mark - integer one-dimensional work array (may be the same as v).
!           dimension = n
!
!    flag - integer error flag.  values and their meanings are -
!             0     no errors detected

!         the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix m are stored
!    row-by-row in the array a.  to identify the individual nonzero
!    entries in each row, we need to know in which column each entry
!    lies.  the column indices which correspond to the nonzero entries
!    of m are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
!    ja(k) = j.  in addition, we need to know where each row starts and
!    how long it is.  the index positions in ja and a where the rows of
!    m begin are stored in the array ia.  i.e., if m(i,j) is the first
!    nonzero entry (stored) in the i-th row and a(k) = m(i,j),  then
!    ia(i) = k.  moreover, the index in ja and a of the first location
!    following the last element in the last row is stored in ia(n+1).
!    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is given by
!    ia(i+1) - ia(i),  the nonzero entries of the i-th row are stored
!    consecutively in
!            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
!    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
!            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).

!         the rows and columns of the original matrix m can be

!    r(i) = c(i) = ic(i) = i  for i=1,...,n.  the solution z is returned
!    in the original order.
!         if the columns have been reordered (i.e.,  c(i).ne.i  for some
!    i), then the driver will call a subroutine (nroc) which rearranges
!    each row of ja and a, leaving the rows in the original order, but

!         the solution of the system of linear equations is divided into

!      nsfc -- the matrix m is processed symbolically to determine where
!               fillin will occur during the numeric factorization.
!      nnfc -- the matrix m is factored numerically into the product ldu
!               of a unit lower triangular matrix l, a diagonal matrix
!               d, and a unit upper triangular matrix u, and the system
!               mx = b  is solved.
!      nnsc -- the linear system  mx = b  is solved using the ldu
!  or           factorization from nnfc.
!      nntc -- the transposed linear system  mt x = b  is solved using
!               the ldu factorization from nnf.
!    for several systems whose coefficient matrices have the same
!    nonzero structure, nsfc need be done only once (for the first
!    system).  then nnfc is done once for each additional system.  for
!    several systems with the same coefficient matrix, nsfc and nnfc
!    need be done only once (for the first system).  then nnsc or nntc
!    is done once for each additional right-hand side.

!
!    ii.  storage of sparse matrices
!         the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix m are stored
!    row-by-row in the array a.  to identify the individual nonzero
!    entries in each row, we need to know in which column each entry
!    lies.  the column indices which correspond to the nonzero entries
!    of m are stored in the array ja.  i.e., if  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
!    ja(k) = j.  in addition, we need to know where each row starts and
!    how long it is.  the index positions in ja and a where the rows of
!    m begin are stored in the array ia.  i.e., if m(i,j) is the first
!    (leftmost) entry in the i-th row and  a(k) = m(i,j),  then
!    ia(i) = k.  moreover, the index in ja and a of the first location
!    following the last element in the last row is stored in ia(n+1).
!    thus, the number of entries in the i-th row is given by
!    ia(i+1) - ia(i),  the nonzero entries of the i-th row are stored
!    consecutively in
!            a(ia(i)),  a(ia(i)+1),  ..., a(ia(i+1)-1),
!    and the corresponding column indices are stored consecutively in
!            ja(ia(i)), ja(ia(i)+1), ..., ja(ia(i+1)-1).
!    for example, the 5 by 5 matrix
!                ( 1. 0. 2. 0. 0.)
!                ( 0. 3. 0. 0. 0.)

!                ( 0. 0. 0. 8. 9.)
!    would be stored as

!
!         the strict upper (lower) triangular portion of the matrix
!    u (l) is stored in a similar fashion using the arrays  iu, ju, u
!    (il, jl, l)  except that an additional array iju (ijl) is used to
!    compress storage of ju (jl) by allowing some sequences of column
!    (row) indices to used for more than one row (column)  (n.b., l is
!    stored by columns).  iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the starting
!    location in ju (jl) of entries for the kth row (column).
!    compression in ju (jl) occurs in two ways.  first, if a row
!    (column) i was merged into the current row (column) k, and the
!    number of elements merged in from (the tail portion of) row
!    (column) i is the same as the final length of row (column) k, then
!    the kth row (column) and the tail of row (column) i are identical
!    and iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the start of the tail.  second, if
!    some tail portion of the (k-1)st row (column) is identical to the
!    head of the kth row (column), then iju(k) (ijl(k)) points to the
!    start of that tail portion.  for example, the nonzero structure of
!    the strict upper triangular part of the matrix
!            d 0 x x x

! DSTODA performs one step of the integration of an initial value
! problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
! Note: DSTODA is independent of the value of the iteration method
! indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
! of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
! Communication with DSTODA is done with the following variables:
!
! Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
!          all calls to F and JAC.
! NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
! YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
!          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
!          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
!          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
!          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
!          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
! NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
! YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
! EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
!          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
!          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
! SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
! ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
!          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
!          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
! WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
!          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
! PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
!          and P = I - H*EL0*Jac, if a chord method is being used.
!          It also returns an estimate of norm(Jac) in PDNORM.
! SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
! CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before PJAC is called.
! H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
!          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
!          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
! HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
! HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
!          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
!          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
!          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
! TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
! JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
!          values and meanings:
!               0  perform the first step.
!           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
!              -1  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
!              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                    but with other inputs unchanged.
!          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
! KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
!               0  the step was succesful.
!              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
!              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
!              -3  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
!          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
!          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
!          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
!          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
!          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
! MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
! MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
! MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls (MITER .gt. 0).
! MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
! METH   = current method.
!          METH = 1 means Adams method (nonstiff)
!          METH = 2 means BDF method (stiff)
!          METH may be reset by DSTODA.
! MITER  = corrector iteration method.
!          MITER = 0 means functional iteration.
!          MITER = JT .gt. 0 means a chord iteration corresponding
!          to Jacobian type JT.  (The DLSODA/DLSODAR argument JT is
!          communicated here as JTYP, but is not used in DSTODA
!          except to load MITER following a method switch.)
!          MITER may be reset by DSTODA.

! DPRJA is called by DSTODA to compute and process the matrix
! P = I - H*EL(1)*J , where J is an approximation to the Jacobian.
! Here J is computed by the user-supplied routine JAC if
! MITER = 1 or 4 or by finite differencing if MITER = 2 or 5.
! J, scaled by -H*EL(1), is stored in WM.  Then the norm of J (the
! matrix norm consistent with the weighted max-norm on vectors given
! by DMNORM) is computed, and J is overwritten by P.  P is then
! subjected to LU decomposition in preparation for later solution
! of linear systems with P as coefficient matrix.  This is done
! by DGEFA if MITER = 1 or 2, and by DGBFA if MITER = 4 or 5.

! WM    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains the
!         LU decomposition of P.
!         Storage of matrix elements starts at WM(3).
!         WM also contains the following matrix-related data:
!         WM(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
! IWM   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
!         IWM(21).   IWM also contains the band parameters
!         ML = IWM(1) and MU = IWM(2) if MITER is 4 or 5.

! This subroutine finds the leftmost root of a set of arbitrary

! of odd multiplicity (i.e. changes of sign of the gi) are found.
! Here the sign of X1 - X0 is arbitrary, but is constant for a given
! problem, and -leftmost- means nearest to X0.
! The values of the vector-valued function g(x) = (gi, i=1...NG)
! are communicated through the call sequence of DROOTS.
! The method used is the Illinois algorithm.

!
! Description of parameters.
!
! NG     = number of functions gi, or the number of components of
!          the vector valued function g(x).  Input only.
!
! HMIN   = resolution parameter in X.  Input only.  When a root is
!          found, it is located only to within an error of HMIN in X.
!          Typically, HMIN should be set to something on the order of
!               100 * UROUND * MAX(ABS(X0),ABS(X1)),
!          where UROUND is the unit roundoff of the machine.
!
! JFLAG  = integer flag for input and output communication.
!
!          On input, set JFLAG = 0 on the first call for the problem,
!          and leave it unchanged until the problem is completed.
!          (The problem is completed when JFLAG .ge. 2 on return.)
!
!          On output, JFLAG has the following values and meanings:
!          JFLAG = 1 means DROOTS needs a value of g(x).  Set GX = g(X)
!                    and call DROOTS again.
!          JFLAG = 2 means a root has been found.  The root is
!                    at X, and GX contains g(X).  (Actually, X is the
!                    rightmost approximation to the root on an interval
!                    (X0,X1) of size HMIN or less.)
!          JFLAG = 3 means X = X1 is a root, with one or more of the gi
!                    being zero at X1 and no sign changes in (X0,X1).
!                    GX contains g(X) on output.
!          JFLAG = 4 means no roots (of odd multiplicity) were
!                    found in (X0,X1) (no sign changes).
!
! X0,X1  = endpoints of the interval where roots are sought.
!          X1 and X0 are input when JFLAG = 0 (first call), and
!          must be left unchanged between calls until the problem is
!          completed.  X0 and X1 must be distinct, but X1 - X0 may be
!          of either sign.  However, the notion of -left- and -right-
!          will be used to mean nearer to X0 or X1, respectively.
!          When JFLAG .ge. 2 on return, X0 and X1 are output, and
!          are the endpoints of the relevant interval.
!
! G0,G1  = arrays of length NG containing the vectors g(X0) and g(X1),
!          respectively.  When JFLAG = 0, G0 and G1 are input and
!          none of the G0(i) should be zero.
!          When JFLAG .ge. 2 on return, G0 and G1 are output.
!
! GX     = array of length NG containing g(X).  GX is input
!          when JFLAG = 1, and output when JFLAG .ge. 2.
!
! X      = independent variable value.  Output only.
!          When JFLAG = 1 on output, X is the point at which g(x)
!          is to be evaluated and loaded into GX.
!          When JFLAG = 2 or 3, X is the root.
!          When JFLAG = 4, X is the right endpoint of the interval, X1.
!
! JROOT  = integer array of length NG.  Output only.
!          When JFLAG = 2 or 3, JROOT indicates which components
!          of g(x) have a root at X.  JROOT(i) is 1 if the i-th
!          component has a root, and JROOT(i) = 0 otherwise.

! DSTODPK performs one step of the integration of an initial value
! problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! The following changes were made to generate Subroutine DSTODPK
! from Subroutine DSTODE:
! 1. The array SAVX was added to the call sequence.
! 2. PJAC and SLVS were replaced by PSOL in the call sequence.
! 3. The Common block /DLPK01/ was added for communication.
! 4. The test constant EPCON is loaded into Common below statement
!    numbers 125 and 155, and used below statement 400.
! 5. The Newton iteration counter MNEWT is set below 220 and 400.
! 6. The call to PJAC was replaced with a call to DPKSET (fixed name),
!    with a longer call sequence, called depending on JACFLG.
! 7. The corrector residual is stored in SAVX (not Y) at 360,
!    and the solution vector is in SAVX in the 380 loop.
! 8. SLVS was renamed DSOLPK and includes NEQ, SAVX, EWT, F, and JAC.
!    SAVX was added because DSOLPK now needs Y and SAVF undisturbed.
! 9. The nonlinear convergence failure count NCFN is set at 430.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Note: DSTODPK is independent of the value of the iteration method
! indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
! of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
! Communication with DSTODPK is done with the following variables:
!
! NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
! Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
!          all calls to F and JAC.
! YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
!          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
!          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
!          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
!          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
!          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
! NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
! YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
! EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
!          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
!          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
! SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
!          Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
!          and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
! SAVX   = an array of working storage, of length N.
! ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
!          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
!          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
! WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
!          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
! CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before DPKSET is called.
! H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
!          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
!          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
! HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
! HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
!          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
!          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
!          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
! TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
! JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
!          values and meanings:
!               0  perform the first step.
!           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
!              -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
!                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
!              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                    but with other inputs unchanged.
!          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
! KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
!               0  the step was succesful.
!              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
!              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
!              -3  fatal error in DPKSET or DSOLPK.
!          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
!          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
!          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
!          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
!          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
! MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
! MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
! MSBP   = maximum number of steps between DPKSET calls (MITER .gt. 0).
! MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
! METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
! N      = the number of first-order differential equations.

! DSTOKA performs one step of the integration of an initial value
! problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
!
! This routine was derived from Subroutine DSTODPK in the DLSODPK
! package by the addition of automatic functional/Newton iteration
! switching and logic for re-use of Jacobian data.
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! Note: DSTOKA is independent of the value of the iteration method
! indicator MITER, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
! of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
! Communication with DSTOKA is done with the following variables:
!
! NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to F and JAC.
! Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
!          all calls to F and JAC.
! YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
!          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
!          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
!          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
!          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
!          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
! NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
! YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
! EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
!          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
!          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
! SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N.
!          Also used for input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1
!          and MAXORD .lt. the current order NQ.
! SAVX   = an array of working storage, of length N.
! ACOR   = a work array of length N, used for the accumulated
!          corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(i) contains
!          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
! WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
!          operations in chord iteration (MITER .ne. 0).
! CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before DSETPK is called.
! H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
!          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
!          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
! HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
! HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
!          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
!          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
!          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
! TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
! JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
!          values and meanings:
!               0  perform the first step.
!           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
!              -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
!                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
!              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                    but with other inputs unchanged.
!          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
! KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
!               0  the step was succesful.
!              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
!              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
!              -3  fatal error in DSETPK or DSOLPK.
!          A return with KFLAG = -1 or -2 means either
!          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
!          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
!          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
!          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
! MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
! MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
! MSBP   = maximum number of steps between DSETPK calls (MITER .gt. 0).
! MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
! METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.

! DSTODI performs one step of the integration of an initial value
! problem for a system of Ordinary Differential Equations.
! Note: DSTODI is independent of the value of the iteration method
! indicator MITER, and hence is independent
! of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
! Communication with DSTODI is done with the following variables:
!
! NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to RES, ADDA,
!          and JAC.
! Y      = an array of length .ge. N used as the Y argument in
!          all calls to RES, JAC, and ADDA.
! NEQ    = integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
!          passed as the NEQ argument in all calls tO RES, G, ADDA,
!          and JAC.
! YH     = an NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
!          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
!          LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(i,j+1) contains the approximate
!          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by H**j/factorial(j)
!          (j = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
!          two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
! NYH    = a constant integer .ge. N, the first dimension of YH.
! YH1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
! EWT    = an array of length N containing multiplicative weights
!          for local error measurements.  Local errors in y(i) are
!          compared to 1.0/EWT(i) in various error tests.
! SAVF   = an array of working storage, of length N. also used for
!          input of YH(*,MAXORD+2) when JSTART = -1 and MAXORD is less
!          than the current order NQ.
!          Same as YDOTI in the driver.
! SAVR   = an array of working storage, of length N.
! ACOR   = a work array of length N used for the accumulated
!          corrections. On a succesful return, ACOR(i) contains
!          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
! WM,IWM = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
!          operations in chord iteration.
! PJAC   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix.
! SLVS   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
! CCMAX  = maximum relative change in H*EL0 before PJAC is called.
! H      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!          H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
!          problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
!          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
! HMIN   = the minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
! HMXI   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
!          HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
!          HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
!          take effect until the next change of H is considered.
! TN     = the independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
! JSTART = an integer used for input only, with the following
!          values and meanings:
!               0  perform the first step.
!           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
!              -1  take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
!                    N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
!              -2  take the next step with a new value of H,
!                    but with other inputs unchanged.
!          On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
! KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings:
!               0  the step was succesful.
!              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
!              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
!              -3  RES ordered immediate return.
!              -4  error condition from RES could not be avoided.
!              -5  fatal error in PJAC or SLVS.
!          A return with KFLAG = -1, -2, or -4 means either
!          ABS(H) = HMIN or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
!          On a return with KFLAG negative, the values of TN and
!          the YH array are as of the beginning of the last
!          step, and H is the last step size attempted.
! MAXORD = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
! MAXCOR = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
! MSBP   = maximum number of steps between PJAC calls.
! MXNCF  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
! METH/MITER = the method flags.  See description in driver.
! N      = the number of first-order differential equations.

!             Solution of Block-Tridiagonal Systems of Linear
!             Algebraic Equations
!             A.C. Hindmarsh
!             February 1977
! The input matrix contains three blocks of elements in each block-row,
! including blocks in the (1,3) and (N,N-2) block positions.
! DDECBT uses block Gauss elimination and Subroutines DGEFA and DGESL
! for solution of blocks.  Partial pivoting is done within
! block-rows only.
!
! Note: this version uses LINPACK routines DGEFA/DGESL instead of
! of dec/sol for solution of blocks, and it uses the BLAS routine DDOT
! for dot product calculations.
!
! Input:
!     M = order of each block.
!     N = number of blocks in each direction of the matrix.
!         N must be 4 or more.  The complete matrix has order M*N.
!     A = M by M by N array containing diagonal blocks.
!         A(i,j,k) contains the (i,j) element of the k-th block.
!     B = M by M by N array containing the super-diagonal blocks
!         (in B(*,*,k) for k = 1,...,N-1) and the block in the (N,N-2)
!         block position (in B(*,*,N)).
!     C = M by M by N array containing the subdiagonal blocks
!         (in C(*,*,k) for k = 2,3,...,N) and the block in the
!         (1,3) block position (in C(*,*,1)).
!    IP = integer array of length M*N for working storage.
! Output:
! A,B,C = M by M by N arrays containing the block-LU decomposition
!         of the input matrix.
!    IP = M by N array of pivot information.  IP(*,k) contains
!         information for the k-th digonal block.
!   IER = 0  if no trouble occurred, or
!       = -1 if the input value of M or N was illegal, or
!       = k  if a singular matrix was found in the k-th diagonal block.
! Use DSOLBT to solve the associated linear system.
!
! External routines required: DGEFA and DGESL (from LINPACK) and
! DDOT (from the BLAS, or Basic Linear Algebra package).

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
! DPRJIS is called to compute and process the matrix
! P = A - H*EL(1)*J, where J is an approximation to the Jacobian dr/dy,
! where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s.  J is computed by columns, either by
! the user-supplied routine JAC if MITER = 1, or by finite differencing
! if MITER = 2.  J is stored in WK, rescaled, and ADDA is called to
! generate P.  The matrix P is subjected to LU decomposition in CDRV.
! P and its LU decomposition are stored separately in WK.
!
! In addition to variables described previously, communication
! with DPRJIS uses the following:
! Y     = array containing predicted values on entry.
! RTEM  = work array of length N (ACOR in DSTODI).
! SAVR  = array containing r evaluated at predicted y. On output it
!         contains the residual evaluated at current values of t and y.
! S     = array containing predicted values of dy/dt (SAVF in DSTODI).
! WK    = real work space for matrices.  On output it contains P and
!         its sparse LU decomposition.  Storage of matrix elements
!         starts at WK(3).
!         WK also contains the following matrix-related data.
!         WK(1) = SQRT(UROUND), used in numerical Jacobian increments.
! IWK   = integer work space for matrix-related data, assumed to be
!         equivalenced to WK.  In addition,  WK(IPRSP) and IWK(IPISP)
!         are assumed to have identical locations.
! EL0   = EL(1) (input).
! IERPJ = output error flag (in COMMON).
!         =  0 if no error.
!         =  1 if zero pivot found in CDRV.
!         = IRES (= 2 or 3) if RES returned IRES = 2 or 3.
!         = -1 if insufficient storage for CDRV (should not occur).
!         = -2 if other error found in CDRV (should not occur here).
! JCUR  = output flag = 1 to indicate that the Jacobian matrix
!         (or approximation) is now current.
! This routine also uses other variables in Common.

!        LDA     INTEGER
!                the leading dimension of the array  ABD .
!

!***AUTHOR  Hindmarsh, Alan C., (LLNL)
!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  Subroutines XERRWD, XSETF, XSETUN, and the function routine IXSAV,
!  as given here, constitute a simplified version of the SLATEC error
!  handling package.
!
!  All arguments are input arguments.
!
!  MSG    = The message (character array).
!  NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
!  NERR   = The error number (not used).
!  LEVEL  = The error level..
!           0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
!           2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
!  NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
!  I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
!  NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
!  R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
!
!  Note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
!  in limited context, in the following ways..
!  1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
!     the message is printed with a format of (1X,A).
!  2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
!     Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
!  3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement   STOP
!     to abort the run.  This statement may be machine-dependent.
!  4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
!     in D21.13 format.

!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  IXSAV saves and recalls one of two error message parameters:
!    LUNIT, the logical unit number to which messages are printed, and
!    MESFLG, the message print flag.
!  This is a modification of the SLATEC library routine J4SAVE.
!
!  Saved local variables..
!   LUNIT  = Logical unit number for messages.  The default is obtained
!            by a call to IUMACH (may be machine-dependent).
!   MESFLG = Print control flag..
!            1 means print all messages (the default).
!            0 means no printing.
!
!  On input..
!    IPAR   = Parameter indicator (1 for LUNIT, 2 for MESFLG).
!    IVALUE = The value to be set for the parameter, if ISET = .TRUE.
!    ISET   = Logical flag to indicate whether to read or write.
!             If ISET = .TRUE., the parameter will be given
!             the value IVALUE.  If ISET = .FALSE., the parameter
!             will be unchanged, and IVALUE is a dummy argument.
!
!  On return..
!    IXSAV = The (old) value of the parameter.
